Question
========

Does the complex number $z=`r z`$ solve the equation below?

$$`r eq`$$


Answerlist
--------

* Yes
* No


Solution
========

Plug in $z=`r z`$. Since we are checking if this equation is true, we should probably put a question mark above the equal sign. I didn't, but keep in mind these equations might be wrong.

$$`r eq2`$$

Expand the terms. Use FOIL for the squared term.

$$`r eq3`$$

Remember $i^2=-1$.
$$`r eq4`$$
Combine like terms.
$$`r eq5`$$
`r fs`
