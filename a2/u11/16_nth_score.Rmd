Question
========

A student has taken `r n` exams and gotten an average of `r a1`. What score does the student need on the next exam to bring the average to `r a2`? (All exams are equally weighted in the average.)


Solution
========

Find the current total.
$$`r n` \cdot `r a1` = `r t1`$$

Find the necessary total.
$$`r n+1`\cdot`r a2` = `r t2`$$

Find the difference of the totals.
$$`r t2`-`r t1` = `r nth`$$

The answer is `r nth`.
