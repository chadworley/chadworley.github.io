<br><h4>Question</h4><button onclick='prev.call(this)'>prev</button><button onclick='next.call(this)'>next</button>
<p>An event has two types of tickets: each adult ticket costs $8.78 and each child ticket costs $3.28. The event sold 65 tickets for a revenue of $361.70.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4><button onclick='shower.call(this)'>Show solution</button><div class='hider' style = 'display: none;'>
<p>Let’s use <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to represent the number of adult tickets and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to represent the number of child tickets. We know the total number of tickets sold is 65.
<span class="math display">\[x+y~=~65\]</span>
The revenue from adults equals the product of $8.78 and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The revenue from children equals the product of $3.28 and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The total revenue is the sum of the two types of revenue, and it equals $361.70.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[8.78x+3.28y~=~361.70\]</span></p>

<p><span class="math display">\[x~=~65-y\]</span></p>
<p>We can now substitute <span class="math inline">\(65-y\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the second equation (the equation from the total revenue).</p>
