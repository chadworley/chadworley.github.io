Question
========

In chemistry, when making aqueous solutions with [acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid) and [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)), it is common to consider the [pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH). Distilled (pure) water at 25Â°C has a pH of 7, and it is neutral because the number of $\mathrm{H^+}$ ions equals the number of $\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions. If an acid is added to water, the pH decreases, the number of $\mathrm{H^+}$ ions increases, and the number of $\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions decreases. If a base is added to water, the pH increases, the number of $\mathrm{H^+}$ ions decreases, and the number of $\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions increases.

At room temperature, water undergoes a [reversible reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_reaction) dictated by [collision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_theory) called [auto-ionization of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ionization_of_water). At each moment, every water molecule has some chance to split into a $\mathrm{H^+}$ and a $\mathrm{OH^-}$. Also at each moment, if a $\mathrm{H^+}$ bumps into a $\mathrm{OH^-}$, they can reform a water molecule.

The bajillions of molecules all taking part in this dance produce a stable equilibrium, described by an [equilibrium constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_constant).

$$\mathrm{\left[H^+\right]\cdot\left[OH^-\right]}~=~10^{-14}$$

where $\mathrm{\left[H^+\right]}$ is the concentration in moles per liter of $\mathrm{H^+}$ and $\mathrm{\left[OH^-\right]}$ is the concentration in moles per liter of $\mathrm{OH^-}$. The equilibrium constant equation shown above holds true for all aqueous solutions (at room temperature, near 1 [bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit)) of atmospheric pressure, and not too concentrated), even after acids or bases are added.

In typical aqueous solutions used in laboratories, the concentration of $\mathrm{H^+}$ varies considerably, over many magnitudes, from about 10 moles per liter down to 0.000000000000001 moles per liter. It is annoying to work with these numbers with lots of place-holder 0s. Using scientific notation can help, but using a logarithmic scale has been a favorite strategy when dealing with numbers that vary over many [orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude). This is what pH is, a logarithmic representation of the concentration of hydrogen ions. In the laboratory, pH will be between -1 and 15.

$$\mathrm{pH~=~-\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)}$$

* If an aqueous solution has $\mathrm{pH}=`r sprintf("%.02f",pH)`$, what is the concentration of hydrogen ions?

Answerlist
--------

`r al`


Solution
========

Plug the given number into the equation.

$$\mathrm{`r sprintf("%.02f",pH)`~=~-\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)}$$

Multiply (or divide) both sides of the equation by $-1$.


$$\mathrm{(-1)\cdot\left(`r sprintf("%.02f",pH)`\right)~=~(-1)\cdot\left(-\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)\right)}$$

Simplify.


$$\mathrm{-`r sprintf("%.02f",pH)`~=~\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)}$$

The inverse of "log10 of" is "10 to the". So, raise each side as the exponent of 10.

$$10^{\mathrm{-`r sprintf("%.02f",pH)`}}~=~10^{\mathrm{\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)}}$$

Simplify. Remember, $\log_{10}\left(10^x\right)\equiv x$ for all real values of $x$.

$$`r sprintf("%.01f",cHman)`\cdot 10^{`r cHexp`}~=~\mathrm{\left[H^+\right]}$$
