Question
========

Find all solutions to the equation:

$`r ex1`$

Answerlist
--------

`r al`


Solution
========

On the left side of the equation, there are two [useful rules](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u18/Exponent_rules.html) to get a single base.

$$b^m \cdot b^n ~\equiv~b^{m+n}$$
$$\frac{b^m}{b^n} ~\equiv~b^{m-n}$$

Use those rules as needed to simplify the left side of the equation.

$`r ex2`$

Now, also, use the rule $b^0\equiv 1$ to get a common base on the right side.

$`r ex3`$

Use the rule that if $b^a = b^c$ then $a=c$ to claim the exponents are equal.

$`r ex4`$

You can use the quadratic formula. However, this quadratic polynomial **factors** easily. Remember, you are looking for two numbers with a sum of `r b` and a product of `r c`. Those two number are `r min(rs)` and `r max(rs)`.

$`r ex5`$

Use the zero-product property to find the solutions.

$$x=`r -rs[1]`~~~~\text{or}~~~~x=`r -rs[2]`$$
