<br><h4>Question</h4><button onclick='prev.call(this)'>prev</button><button onclick='next.call(this)'>next</button>
<p>In chemistry, when making aqueous solutions with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid">acids</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)">bases</a>, it is common to consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH">pH</a>. Distilled (pure) water at 25°C has a pH of 7, and it is neutral because the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> ions equals the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span> ions. If an acid is added to water, the pH decreases, the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> ions increases, and the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span> ions decreases. If a base is added to water, the pH increases, the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> ions decreases, and the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span> ions increases.</p>
<p>At room temperature, water undergoes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_reaction">reversible reaction</a> dictated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_theory">collision theory</a> called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ionization_of_water">auto-ionization of water</a>. At each moment, every water molecule has some chance to split into a <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span>. Also at each moment, if a <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> bumps into a <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span>, they can reform a water molecule.</p>
<p>The bajillions of molecules all taking part in this dance produce a stable equilibrium, described by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_constant">equilibrium constant</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{\left[H^+\right]\cdot\left[OH^-\right]}~=~10^{-14}\]</span></p>

The equilibrium constant equation shown above holds true for all aqueous solutions (at room temperature, near 1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit)">bar</a> of atmospheric pressure, and not too concentrated), even after acids or bases are added.</p>
<p>In typical aqueous solutions used in laboratories, the concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> varies considerably, over many magnitudes, from about 10 moles per liter down to 0.000000000000001 moles per liter. It is annoying to work with these numbers with lots of place-holder 0s. Using scientific notation can help, but using a logarithmic scale has been a favorite strategy when dealing with numbers that vary over many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude">orders of magnitude</a>. This is what pH is, a logarithmic representation of the concentration of hydrogen ions. In the laboratory, pH will be between -1 and 15.</p>

<p>In chemistry, when making aqueous solutions with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid">acids</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)">bases</a>, it is common to consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH">pH</a>. Distilled (pure) water at 25°C has a pH of 7, and it is neutral because the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> ions equals the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span> ions. If an acid is added to water, the pH decreases, the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> ions increases, and the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span> ions decreases. If a base is added to water, the pH increases, the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> ions decreases, and the number of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span> ions increases.</p>
<p>At room temperature, water undergoes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_reaction">reversible reaction</a> dictated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_theory">collision theory</a> called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ionization_of_water">auto-ionization of water</a>. At each moment, every water molecule has some chance to split into a <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span>. Also at each moment, if a <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H^+}\)</span> bumps into a <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{OH^-}\)</span>, they can reform a water molecule.</p>
