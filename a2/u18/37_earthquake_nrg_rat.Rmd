Question
========

When two separate earthquakes occur, we are often interested in comparing their energies as a ratio (to say how many times more energy the larger one released). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale#Comparative_energy_released_by_two_earthquakes) provided me with the following formula to do this:

$$\frac{E_2}{E_1}~=~10^{1.5(M_2-M_1)}$$

If the smaller earthquake had a magnitude of `r M[1]` and the larger earthquake had a magnitude of `r M[2]`, then how many times larger was the energy released by the larger earthquake than the smaller earthquake?



Solution
========

Plug the numbers into the equation.

$$\frac{E_2}{E_1}~=~10^{1.5(`r M[2]`-`r M[1]`)}$$


Evaluate.


$$\frac{E_2}{E_1}~=~`r Erat`$$

Notice, $E_2~=~(`r Erat`)\cdot E_1$, so the larger energy is `r Erat` times the smaller energy.
