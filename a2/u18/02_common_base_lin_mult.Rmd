```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
mxba = sample(2:9,4)
m = mxba[1]
x = mxba[2]
b = mxba[3]
a = mxba[4]
y = m*x+b

```

Question
========

As seen in our [list of exponent rules](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u18/Exponent_rules.html):

$$a^{m+n} \equiv a^m \cdot a^n$$

Use that fun fact to solve the equation below.

$$`r a`^{`r m`x}\cdot `r a`^{`r b`}~=~`r a`^{`r y`}$$

* $x=~?$ 

Solution
========

Use the given rule to write the left side as a single exponential expression.

$$`r a`^{`r m`x+`r b`}~=~`r a`^{`r y`}$$


Because we have a common base on both sides of the equation, we know the exponents are equal.

$$`r m`x+`r b` ~=~ `r y`$$

Subtract `r b` from both sides of the equation.


$$`r m`x ~=~ `r y-b`$$

Divide both sides by `r m`.


$$x ~=~ `r x`$$
