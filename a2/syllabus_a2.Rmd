## Classroom Procedures & Expectations

* Typical class:
    * Entrance ticket (typically a few standardized-test questions)
    * Instruction
    * Individual/group work.
* Quietude:
    * Last year I struggled to keep classes quiet enough for students to focus. I felt very bad for these students who became more frustrated through the year.
    * An incredibly useful concept is [negative externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality). When individuals pursue self interests, they often cause costs onto others. Common examples are pollution (chemical or noise). A society should tax these behaviors for the betterment of the whole.

## Work turn in policy

* Turn work in **ON CANVAS**. Do not send it to me in an email. 
* Because most questions have randomly generated numbers, I can allow many attempts at each question type. I will always use **highest** grade with retakes.

## Late Work Policy

* Most assignments are automatically graded. This gives you immediate feedback, and allows me to be more lenient in accepting late work.
* Each day late incurs a -2% penalty, down to -30% at the most extreme. In other words, if you hand it in $x$ days late, and you get a fraction $y$ of the points (where $y$ is between 0 and 1), then your late-adjusted fraction will be:
$$y_{\mathrm{adj}} = y-0.02 \cdot y\cdot \min(15,\,\lfloor x \rfloor)$$
But, each quarter's work will not be accepted after the quarter ends.

## Academic Honesty

* Be honest with your assignments. Cite your sources.
* If a test does not allow notes, don't use notes.

## Absent Students

* If a student is absent they should get the # of days out +1 to make up the work. If a student is struggling with this they should reach out to the teacher to discuss.

## Participation

* I appreciate participation. However, I will try to minimize requirements of vocal participation.
* More importantly, please do not cause distractions.
