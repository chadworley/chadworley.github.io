* N-CN.A.1: Know there is a complex number $i$ such that $i^2$ = −1, and every complex number has the form $a + bi$ with $x-a$ and $b$ real.
* N-CN.A.2: Use the relation $i^22 = –1$ and the Commutative, Associative, and Distributive properties to add, subtract, and multiply complex numbers.
* N-CN.C.7: Solve quadratic equations with real coefficients that have complex solutions.
* N-CN.C.8: (+) Extend polynomial identities to the complex numbers. For example, rewrite $x^2+4$ as $(x+2i)(x-2i)$
* N-CN.C.9: (+) Know the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra; show that it is true for quadratic polynomials.
* A-SSE.A.1: Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context. For example, interpret $P(1+r)^n$ as the product of $P$ and a factor not depending on $P$.
* A-SSE.A.1.a: Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients.
* A-SSE.A.1.b: Interpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity.
* A-SSE.A.2: Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it. For example, see $x^4-y^4$ as $(x^2)^2-(y^2)^2$, thus... $(x-y)(x+y)(x-yi)(x+yi)$.
* A-APR.A.1: Understand that polynomials form a system analogous to the integers, namely, they are closed under certain operations.
* A-APR.A.1.a: Perform operations on polynomial expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and compare the system of polynomials to the system of integers when performing operations.
* A-APR.B.2: Know and apply the Remainder Theorem: For a polynomial $p(x)$ and a number $a$, the remainder on division by $x – a$ is $p(a)$, so $p(a) = 0$ if and only if $(x – a)$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
* A-APR.B.3: Identify zeros of polynomials when suitable factorizations are available, and use the zeros to construct a rough graph of the function defined by the polynomial.
* A-APR.C.4: Prove polynomial identities and use them to describe numerical relationships. For example, the polynomial identity $(x^2 + y^2)^2 = (x^2 – y^2)^2 + (2xy)^2$ can be used to generate Pythagorean triples.
* A-APR.C.5: (+) Know and apply the Binomial Theorem for the expansion of $(x + y)^n$ in powers of $x$ and $y$ for a positive integer $n$, where $x$ and $y$ are any numbers, with coefficients determined for example by Pascal’s Triangle.
* A-APR.D.6: Rewrite simple rational expressions in different forms; write $a(x)∕b(x)$ in the form $q(x) + r(x)∕b(x)$, where $a(x)$, $b(x)$, $q(x)$, and $r(x)$ are polynomials with the degree of $r(x)$ less than the degree of $b(x)$, using inspection, long division, or, for the more complicated examples, a computer algebra system.
* A-APR.D.7: (+) Understand that rational expressions form a system analogous to the rational numbers, closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by a nonzero rational expression; add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational expressions.
* A-CED.A.1: Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. Include equations arising from simple root and rational functions and exponential functions.
* A-CED.A.2: Create equations in two or more variables to represent relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.
* A-CED.A.3: Represent constraints by equations or inequalities, and by systems of equations and/or inequalities, and interpret solutions as viable or non-viable options in a modeling context. For example, represent equations describing satellites orbiting Earth and constraints on Earth’s size and atmosphere.
* A-REI.A.2: Solve simple rational and radical equations in one variable, and give examples showing how extraneous solutions may arise.
* A-REI.D.11: Explain why the $x$-coordinates of the points where the graphs of the equations $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$ intersect are the solutions of the equation $f(x) = g(x)$; find the solutions approximately, e.g., using technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find successive approximations. Include cases where $f(x)$ and/or $g(x)$ are polynomial, rational, and logarithmic functions.
* F-IF.B.4: For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the relationship. Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.
* F-IF.B.5: Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable, to the quantitative relationship it describes. For example, if the function h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.
* F-IF.B.6: Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.
* F-IF.C.7: Graph functions expressed symbolically and show key features of the graph; by hand in simple cases and using technology for more complicated cases.
* F-IF.C.7.c: Graph polynomial functions, identifying zeros when suitable factorizations are available, and showing end behavior.
* F-IF.C.8: Write a function defined by an expression in different but equivalent forms to reveal and explain different properties of the function. %%quadratic forms for rational unit
* F-IF.C.8.a: Use the process of factoring in a polynomial function to show zeros, extreme values, and symmetry of the graph and interpret these in terms of a context.
