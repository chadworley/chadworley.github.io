Question
========

* Events $A$ and $B$ are [mutually exclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusivity) if and only if $P(A \cap B)=0$.
* Events $A$ and $B$ are [independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)) if and only if $P(A \cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$.


Consider the following:

$$P(A)=`r PA`$$

$$P(B)=`r PB`$$

$$P(A \cup B)=`r PU`$$

Are events $A$ and $B$ independent, mutually exclusive, or neither?

Answerlist
--------

* Independent
* Mutually exclusive
* Neither


Solution
========

First, find the probability of getting A and B.

$$P(A \cap B) ~=~ P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cup B)$$

$$P(A \cap B) ~=~ `r PA`+`r PB`-`r PU`$$

$$P(A \cap B) ~=~ `r PN`$$

`r soltxt`
