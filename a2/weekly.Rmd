## Week 1

### Wednesday Aug 21

* [First day survey](https://forms.gle/UiZrKtkPGFZ7Po8F9)
* Students will participate in a survey. We discuss some of the questions together.
* *S-IC.B: Make inferences and justify conclusions from sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies.*

### Thursday Aug 22

* Look at syllabus.
* Define population, parameter, sample, and statistic.
* Discuss how the goal of Statistics is to estimate population parameters from sample statistics.
* [Slides](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u01/p01_sam_stat_pop_prop.html)
* [Practice problems](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u01/u01_shared1.html#Q1v1)
* **Canvas** (like the practice problems)
* *S-IC.A.1: Understand statistics as a process for making inferences to be made about population parameters based on a random sample from that population.*

### Friday Aug 23

* Simulate dice (based on discrete-uniform model)
* Investigate "Margin of Error" and "Interval of typical means"
* Roll dice (the dice might be 3D printed...)
* Compare. Write reports.
* *S-IC.A.2: Decide if a specified model is consistent with results from a given data-generating process, e.g., using simulation.*

## Week 2

### Monday Aug 26

* We define survey, experiment, and observational study. We discuss the importance of random samples and random assignment.
* [Slides](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u01/p02_survey_experi_obsstu.html)
* [Practice Problems](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u01/u01_shared1.html#Q2v1)
