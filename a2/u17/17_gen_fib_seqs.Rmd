Question
========

As stated in [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers), many variations of the Fibonacci sequence have been studied. Consider the following recursive definition:

$$\begin{align}f(n)~~&=~~`r k`\cdot f(n-2)~+~f(n-1)\\
f(1)~~&=~~0\\
f(2)~~&=~~1
\end{align}$$

Find $f(`r n`)$. The tolerance is $\pm 0.1$.

Solution
========

Type the equations into Desmos. Click `Create Table`. Extend the table to $x=`r n`$ to find $f(`r n`)$.

$$f(`r n`)=`r fa`$$
