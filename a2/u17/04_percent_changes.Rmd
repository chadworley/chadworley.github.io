Question
========

On Monday morning, an investor purchased a stock for $`r sprintf("%.02f",p0)`. `r ch` After the three days, what was the final price of the stock?


Solution
========

Find all the scale factors. Find the product of the inital price and all the scale factors.

$$`r p0`\cdot `r paste0(mults,collapse="\\cdot")`~=~`r round(prod(mults)*p0,2)`$$

If you wanted to, you could break this down into three changes.

$$P_1 ~=~ `r mults[1]`\cdot `r p0` ~=~ `r p1`$$
$$P_2 ~=~ `r mults[2]`\cdot `r p1` ~=~ `r p2`$$
$$P_3 ~=~ `r mults[3]`\cdot `r p2` ~=~ `r pf`$$

Now, most stocks are reported rounded to the nearest cent... so these intermediate values might not be entirely realistic... but please do not round the intermediate values when doing this problem.
