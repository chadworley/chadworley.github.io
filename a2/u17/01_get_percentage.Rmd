Question
========

`r prompt`

Please write your answer using **3 significant figures**.

Solution
========

Use the English-to-Math translation table.

| English | Math |
|:---:|:---:|
| is | $=$ |
| what | $x$ |
| percentage of | $\cdot$ (multiplication) |

Because the question is asking for a percentage, you will need to 

Write the statement in algebraic notation.
$$`r s1`$$

Solve the equation.

$$x=`r fraction`$$

Expressed as a percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100 and multiply by "%".


$$x=`r perstex`$$
