Question
========

In a [forest diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)#Terminology), there are `r a` [complete m-ary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ary_tree) trees. Each tree has a [branching factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_factor) of `r b` and a maximum [depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)#Terminology) of `r n-1`.

How many nodes are in the forest diagram? In other words, what is the [size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)#Terminology) of the forest?



Solution
========

We can recognize that the number of nodes can be represented with a [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series).

$$S~=~`r paste0(a,"(",b,")^",0:(n-1),collapse="+")`$$

The first term is $a=`r a`$. The common ratio is $r=`r b`$. The number of terms is $n=`r n`$. We can use the [partial geometric series formula](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u17/slides_sum_geometric/sum_geometric.pdf).

$$S~=~\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$$


$$S~=~\frac{`r a`\left(1-`r b`^{`r n`}\right)}{1-`r b`}$$

$$S~=~`r S`$$
