Let a [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) have an initial term $a$ and common ratio $r$. The sum, $S$, of the partial series ending at the $n$th term can be expressed using [ellipsis notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis#In_mathematical_notation).

$$S ~=~ a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-3} + ar^{n-2}+ar^{n-1}$$

Multiply both sides by $r$, and distribute to all the terms on the right side.

$$rS ~=~ ar+ar^2+ar^3+ \cdots + ar^{n-2} + ar^{n-1}+ar^{n}$$

Subtract the second equation from the first equation. Notice many terms "cancel out".

$$S-rS ~=~ a-ar^n$$

Factor the left side.

$$S(1-r) ~=~ a-ar^n$$

Divide both sides by $(1-r)$.

$$S~=~ \frac{a-ar^n}{1-r}$$

Boom.
