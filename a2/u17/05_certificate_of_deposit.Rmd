Question
========

Consider a [certificate of deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit) (CD) with `r r*100`% [APY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_yield) and a maturity term of `r n` years. An investor invests $`r P` in this CD. When the CD matures (after `r n` years), how much money can be withdrawn?


Solution
========

Each year the value increases by `r r*100`%, and this compounding occurs `r n` times.

Find the [scale factor](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u17/slides_percent/slides_percent.html).
$$1+`r r`~=~ `r 1+r`$$

Multiply the principal ($`r P`) by the scale factor `r n` times. Remember, repeated multiplication can be represented with an exponent.

$$`r P`\cdot `r 1+r`^{`r n`}~=~ `r round(A,2)`$$

So, after `r n` years, this CD is worth $`r round(A,2)`. You need to remember to withdraw in a short grace period, otherwise the money will typically roll into a new CD, and you'll need to wait another `r n` years to withdraw without penalties.
