```{r,echo=FALSE}
options(scipen=99)

k = round(1+runif(1,0.01,0.2)*sample(c(-1,1),1),3)
n = sample(8:15,1)

f = k^(0:(n-1))
S = sum(f)

```


Question
========

Consider the geometric series with the following recursive definition:

$$f(n)~=~`r k`\cdot f(n-1)$$
$$f(1)~=~1$$

Find the sum of the first `r n` terms of the series.

$$\sum_{n=1}^{`r n`}f(n) ~=~ ?$$

*The tolerance is $\pm 0.1$.*


Solution
========

In Desmos, you can type in the first two equations to define the sequence recursively. Click `Create Table` and generate the first `r n` terms:


`r paste0("$$f(",1:n,")~=~",f,"$$",collapse="\n")`

Now, you just need to add all `r n` terms.

$$`r paste0("f(",1:n,")",collapse="+")` ~=~ `r S`$$

Luckily, Desmos understands [Capital-sigma notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation#Capital-sigma_notation)! To get the upper-case sigma, which means "sum", you can type `sum`. You should be able to type the expression using the [summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) operator.
