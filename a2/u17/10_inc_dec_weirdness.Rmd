Question
========

A stock is purchased at $`r P`. During the first day, the price `r incdec[1]` by `r p`%. During the second day, the price `r incdec[2]` by `r p`%. What is the price of the stock after the second day?

(*Do not round the intermediate steps. Your final answer should be accurate to at least the nearest cent.*)

Solution
========

Find the first [scale factor](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u17/slides_percent/slides_percent.html#(1)).
$$s_1 ~=~ `r k1`$$
Find the second scale factor.
$$s_2 ~=~ `r k2`$$

To find the final price, multiply the initial price by both scale factors.

$$`r P` \cdot `r k1` \cdot `r k2` ~=~ `r A`$$

And isn't it interesting that these two percent changes do not "undo" each other to bring the final price back to the initial price.
