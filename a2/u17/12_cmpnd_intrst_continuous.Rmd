Question
========

An investment earns compound interest with [continuous compounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest#Continuous_compounding).

* Principal = $P=`r P`$ USD
* Nominal [annual interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate#Multiple_definitions_of_effective_APR) = $r~=~`r r` ~=~`r 100*r`\%$
* Compounding frequency = $n\to\infty$ per year
* Time = $t=`r t`$ years

Calculate the amount, in USD, after `r t` years by using the continuous compounding formula.

$$A ~=~ Pe^{rt}$$
[Euler's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)), $e$, is approximately `r exp(1)`. You can round to the nearest dollar. (*Tolerance is $\pm 1$*.)

Solution
========

$$A ~=~ `r P` \cdot e^{(`r r`)(`r t`)} ~=~ `r round(A,2)`$$
