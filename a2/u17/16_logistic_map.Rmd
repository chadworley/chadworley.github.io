Question
========

In Desmos, we can [produce sequences defined recursively](https://help.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/25917735966989-Recursion#h_01HVHM10ASS971T6VMMHEX9HD9). In basic [Chaos Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory), it is common to discuss the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map).

Let's produce a sequence using the logistic map with $r=`r r`$ and $f(1)=`r f1`$. In Desmos, write the following expressions:
$$f(n)~=~ `r r`\cdot f(n-1) \cdot \Big(1-f(n-1)\Big)$$
$$f(1)~=~ `r f1`$$

You can then click on the `Create Table` button that shows up to the left of your first equation. If you click on the last row's $x$ value and repeatedly hit the `Enter` key on your keyboard, you can extend the sequence as far as you'd like.

Find the **`r n``r end`** term of the sequence.

$$f(`r n`)~=~ ?$$


Solution
========

$$f(`r n`)=`r fn`$$
