```{r,echo=F,warning=F}
options(scipen=99)
pmant = sample(150:950,1)/100
pexp = sample(0:1,1) #sample(0:2,1)
percentage = signif(pmant*10^pexp,3)
fraction = signif(percentage/100,3)
total = signif(2^(runif(1,1,10)),3)
part = total-fraction*total

extol = 10^(floor(log(part,10))-2)

```

Question
========

What is `r percentage`% less than `r total`?


Solution
========

For a "percent less" question, the scale factor is found by dividing the percentage number by 100 and then subtracting it from 1.

Determine that the scale factor equals `r 1-fraction` and multiply it by the given value.

$$`r 1-fraction`\cdot `r total` ~=~ `r part`$$
