<br><h4>Question</h4><button onclick='prev.call(this)'>prev</button><button onclick='next.call(this)'>next</button>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric distribution</a> describes the probability of getting a certain number of failures in a row before succeeding when repeatedly attempting a trial with fixed chance of success.</p>
<p>Imagine a trial that has, for each attempt, a <span class="math inline">\(19\%\)</span> chance of success and a <span class="math inline">\(81\%\)</span> chance of failure. (On each trial you either succeed or fail.) You will repeatedly attempt until you succeed.</p>
<p>What is the probability of your first success occurring <strong>before</strong> your eighth attempt?</p>
<br/>
<h4>Solution</h4><button onclick='shower.call(this)'>Show solution</button><div class='hider' style = 'display: none;'>
<p>We (hopefully) already learned how to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function">probability mass function</a> of the geometric distribution. We can use <span class="math inline">\(p=0.19\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q=0.81\)</span> to represent the simple probabilities of each attempt.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on first attempt})~=~pq^0~=~0.19(0.81)^{0}~=~0.19\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on second attempt})~=~pq^1~=~0.19(0.81)^{1}~=~0.1539\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on third attempt})~=~pq^2~=~0.19(0.81)^{2}~=~0.124659\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on fourth attempt})~=~pq^3~=~0.19(0.81)^{3}~=~0.10097379\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on fifth attempt})~=~pq^4~=~0.19(0.81)^{4}~=~0.0817887699\]</span>

<span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on seventh attempt})~=~pq^6~=~0.19(0.81)^{6}~=~0.05366161193139\]</span></p>
<p>Each of the probabilities shown above corresponds to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusivity">mutually exclusive</a> event. For example, if the first success was on the third attempt, then the first success was <strong>not</strong> on the fourth attempt.</p>
<p>We need to find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">cumulative probability</a>. Because of mutual exclusivity, we can simply add the probabilities shown above.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success in fewer than 8 attempts})~=~0.19(0.81)^{0}+0.19(0.81)^{1}+0.19(0.81)^{2}+0.19(0.81)^{3}+0.19(0.81)^{4}+0.19(0.81)^{5}+0.19(0.81)^{6}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice this is a geometric series. The first term is <span class="math inline">\(a=0.19\)</span>. The common ratio is <span class="math inline">\(r=0.81\)</span>. The number of terms is <span class="math inline">\(n=7\)</span>. We wish to find the sum (<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) of the series. The following steps are meant to remind you of the steps in the proof of the partial geometric series formula, but shown with specific numbers.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s~=~0.19(0.81)^{0}+0.19(0.81)^{1}+0.19(0.81)^{2}+0.19(0.81)^{3}+0.19(0.81)^{4}+0.19(0.81)^{5}+0.19(0.81)^{6}\]</span></p>
<p>Multiply both sides by the common ratio.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0.81s~=~0.19(0.81)^{1}+0.19(0.81)^{2}+0.19(0.81)^{3}+0.19(0.81)^{4}+0.19(0.81)^{5}+0.19(0.81)^{6}+0.19(0.81)^{7}\]</span></p>
<p>Subtract the equations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s-0.81s~=~0.19-0.19(0.81)^{7}\]</span></p>
<p>Solve for the sum by factoring and dividing.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s~=~\frac{0.19-0.19(0.81)^{7}}{1-0.81}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[s~=~0.7712321\]</span></p>
<p>You could generalize your results to give a formula for the cumulative geometric distribution.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success before }n+1\text{ attempts})~=~\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}pq^i ~=~ \frac{p-pq^n}{1-q}\]</span></p>

<br><h4>Question</h4><button onclick='prev.call(this)'>prev</button><button onclick='next.call(this)'>next</button>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric distribution</a> describes the probability of getting a certain number of failures in a row before succeeding when repeatedly attempting a trial with fixed chance of success.</p>
<p>Imagine a trial that has, for each attempt, a <span class="math inline">\(25\%\)</span> chance of success and a <span class="math inline">\(75\%\)</span> chance of failure. (On each trial you either succeed or fail.) You will repeatedly attempt until you succeed.</p>
<p>What is the probability of your first success occurring <strong>before</strong> your sixth attempt?</p>
<br/>
<h4>Solution</h4><button onclick='shower.call(this)'>Show solution</button><div class='hider' style = 'display: none;'>
<p>We (hopefully) already learned how to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function">probability mass function</a> of the geometric distribution. We can use <span class="math inline">\(p=0.25\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q=0.75\)</span> to represent the simple probabilities of each attempt.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on first attempt})~=~pq^0~=~0.25(0.75)^{0}~=~0.25\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on second attempt})~=~pq^1~=~0.25(0.75)^{1}~=~0.1875\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on third attempt})~=~pq^2~=~0.25(0.75)^{2}~=~0.140625\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on fourth attempt})~=~pq^3~=~0.25(0.75)^{3}~=~0.10546875\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success on fifth attempt})~=~pq^4~=~0.25(0.75)^{4}~=~0.0791015625\]</span></p>
<p>Each of the probabilities shown above corresponds to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusivity">mutually exclusive</a> event. For example, if the first success was on the third attempt, then the first success was <strong>not</strong> on the fourth attempt.</p>
<p>We need to find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">cumulative probability</a>. Because of mutual exclusivity, we can simply add the probabilities shown above.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success in fewer than 6 attempts})~=~0.25(0.75)^{0}+0.25(0.75)^{1}+0.25(0.75)^{2}+0.25(0.75)^{3}+0.25(0.75)^{4}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice this is a geometric series. The first term is <span class="math inline">\(a=0.25\)</span>. The common ratio is <span class="math inline">\(r=0.75\)</span>. The number of terms is <span class="math inline">\(n=5\)</span>. We wish to find the sum (<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) of the series.

<p><span class="math display">\[s~=~0.25(0.75)^{0}+0.25(0.75)^{1}+0.25(0.75)^{2}+0.25(0.75)^{3}+0.25(0.75)^{4}\]</span></p>
<p>Multiply both sides by the common ratio.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0.75s~=~0.25(0.75)^{1}+0.25(0.75)^{2}+0.25(0.75)^{3}+0.25(0.75)^{4}+0.25(0.75)^{5}\]</span></p>
<p>Subtract the equations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s-0.75s~=~0.25-0.25(0.75)^{5}\]</span></p>
<p>Solve for the sum by factoring and dividing.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s~=~\frac{0.25-0.25(0.75)^{5}}{1-0.75}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[s~=~0.7626953\]</span></p>
<p>You could generalize your results to give a formula for the cumulative geometric distribution.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{first success before }n+1\text{ attempts})~=~\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}pq^i ~=~ \frac{p-pq^n}{1-q}\]</span></p>
