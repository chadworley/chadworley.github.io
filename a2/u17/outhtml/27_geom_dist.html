<br><h4>Question</h4><button onclick='prev.call(this)'>prev</button><button onclick='next.call(this)'>next</button>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric distribution</a> describes the probability of getting a certain number of failures in a row before succeeding when repeatedly attempting a trial with fixed chance of success.</p>
<p>Imagine a trial that has, for each attempt, a <span class="math inline">\(8\%\)</span> chance of success and a <span class="math inline">\(92\%\)</span> chance of failure. (On each trial you either succeed or fail.) You will repeatedly attempt until you succeed.</p>
<p>What is the probability of your first success occurring on your tenth attempt?</p>
<br/>
<h4>Solution</h4><button onclick='shower.call(this)'>Show solution</button><div class='hider' style = 'display: none;'>
<p>In order for your first success to come on the tenth attempt, you need to fail 9 times and then succeed.</p>
<p>So, you need to fail on the first attempt, fail on the second attempt, fail on the third attempt, fail on the fourth attempt, fail on the fifth attempt, fail on the sixth attempt, fail on the seventh attempt, fail on the eighth attempt, fail on the ninth attempt, and then <strong>succeed</strong> on the tenth attempt.</p>
<p>Each attempt is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)">independent</a>. This means the compound event’s probability is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics)">product</a> of the basic events’ probabilities.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail first trial})~=~0.92\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail second trial})~=~0.92\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail third trial})~=~0.92\]</span>

<span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail ninth trial})~=~0.92\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{succeed tenth attempt})~=~0.08\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail on first 9 attempts and succeed on tenth attempt})~=~(0.92)^{9}(0.08)^1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail on first 9 attempts and succeed on tenth attempt})~=~0.0377729\]</span></p>
<p>So the probability of having the first success be on the tenth attempt is 3.7772909%, which is 0.0377729 as a decimal probability.</p>

<p>What is the probability of your first success occurring on your sixth attempt?</p>

<p>In order for your first success to come on the sixth attempt, you need to fail 5 times and then succeed.</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail on first 5 attempts and succeed on sixth attempt})~=~0.0465259\]</span></p>
