<br><h4>Question</h4><button onclick='prev.call(this)'>prev</button><button onclick='next.call(this)'>next</button>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric distribution</a> describes the probability of getting a certain number of failures in a row before succeeding when repeatedly attempting a trial with fixed chance of success.</p>
<p>Imagine a trial that has, for each attempt, a <span class="math inline">\(11\%\)</span> chance of success and a <span class="math inline">\(89\%\)</span> chance of failure. (On each trial you either succeed or fail.) You will repeatedly attempt until you succeed.</p>
<p>What is the probability of your first success occurring on your fifth attempt?</p>
<br/>
<h4>Solution</h4><button onclick='shower.call(this)'>Show solution</button><div class='hider' style = 'display: none;'>
<p>In order for your first success to come on the fifth attempt, you need to fail 4 times and then succeed.</p>
<p>So, you need to fail on the first attempt, fail on the second attempt, fail on the third attempt, fail on the fourth attempt, and then <strong>succeed</strong> on the fifth attempt.</p>
<p>Each attempt is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)">independent</a>. This means the compound event’s probability is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics)">product</a> of the basic events’ probabilities.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail first trial})~=~0.89\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail second trial})~=~0.89\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail third trial})~=~0.89\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail fourth trial})~=~0.89\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{succeed fifth attempt})~=~0.11\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail on first 4 attempts and succeed on fifth attempt})~=~(0.89)^{4}(0.11)^1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{fail on first 4 attempts and succeed on fifth attempt})~=~0.0690165\]</span></p>
<p>So the probability of having the first success be on the fifth attempt is 6.9016465%, which is 0.0690165 as a decimal probability.</p>
