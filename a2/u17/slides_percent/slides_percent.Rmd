# Scale factor

When dealing with "percent of" or "percent more" or "percent less", it is helpful to find the scale factor.

# Percent of

* In a "percent of" problem, the scale factor is simply the percentage number divided by 100.
* Example, find 23% of 456.
$$0.23\cdot 456 = `r 0.23*456`$$

# Percent more

* In a "percent more" problem, the scale factor is simply the percentage number divided by 100, and then the result is added to 1.
* Example, find 23% more than 456.
$$1.23\cdot 456 = `r 1.23*456`$$

# Percent less

* In a "percent less" problem, the scale factor is simply the percentage number divided by 100, and then the result is subtracted from 1.
* Example, find 23% less than 456.
$$0.77\cdot 456 = `r 0.77*456`$$
