Question
========

<!-- Savings accounts often earn interest payments. Those payments are typically added to the account, so the account grows, and then that in turn increases how much is added by the next interest payment. This phenomenon of interest payments later earning interest is called [compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest). Because the growth of the savings account is proportional to the current value, we get exponential growth. -->

If you read the articles on [effective interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_interest_rate) and [APY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_yield), you'll see the same equation (with slightly different variables).

$$r ~=~ \left(1+\frac{i}{N}\right)^N-1$$

where

$$\begin{align}
r &= \text{effective interest rate or APY} \\
i &= \text{nominal interest rate or APR} \\
N &= \text{frequency of compounding}
\end{align}$$
