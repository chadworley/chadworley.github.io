Question
========

For Earth, 1 degree of latitude is approximately 111 kilometers (or 69 miles). Near the equator, 1 degree of longitude is also approximately 111 kilometers (but this gets smaller near the poles). 

Latitude and longitude are often expressed as an ordered pair. Personally, I prefer [decimal degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees), instead of using a [degrees-minutes-seconds notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#Subdivisions).

A boat starts at [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island), whose geographic coordinates are [0.00,0.00]. The boat points at a [true bearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(navigation)#Absolute) of `r bearing`Â° and travels `r distance` kilometers. Assuming that 1 degree of latitude or longitude is equal to exactly 111 kilometers, and assuming neither the ocean current nor the wind has any effect, find the new geographic coordinates in decimal degrees.
