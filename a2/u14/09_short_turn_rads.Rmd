Question
========

In the video game [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)), a player rotates a space ship to aim projectiles at asteroids.

The ship is located at $(0,0)$ and currently points towards $(`r x1`, `r y1`)$. The ship hopes to rotate to aim at $(`r x2`, `r y2`)$ with as little turning as possible. Using **radians**, and positive (or negative) for counterclockwise (or clockwise), what turning angle should the ship use? 

(*The tolerance is $\pm 0.001$ radians.*)


Solution
========

I would first use [two-argument arctangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) to find a standard angle (rotating from positive $x$ axis) for each given point. In Desmos, you can just use ``arctan(`r y1`,`r x1`)`` and ``arctan(`r y2`,`r x2`)``. Remember, RADIAN MODE.

$$\theta_1 ~=~ \arctan(`r y1`,`r x1`)~=~`r round(th1,4)`$$

$$\theta_2 ~=~ \arctan(`r y2`,`r x2`)~=~`r round(th2,4)`$$

Now... unfortunately... we cannot simply assume $\theta_2-\theta_1$ will give the desired turning angle. It would definitely accomplish the task of turning from point 1 to point 2, but $\theta_2-\theta_1$ might not be the smallest turn. To make sure we get the smallest turning angle, we can consider 3 coterminal turning angles.

$$\alpha ~=~ \theta_2-\theta_1$$
$$\beta ~=~ \alpha+2\pi$$
$$\gamma ~=~ \alpha-2\pi$$

Using the formulae above, calculate the three possible turning angles that would turn from the first point to the second point.

$$\alpha ~=~ `r round(alr,3)`$$
$$\beta ~=~ `r round(ber,3)`$$
$$\gamma ~=~ `r round(gar,3)`$$

Find the option with the least ABSOLUTE value. Also, remember, in math, positive angles correspond to counterclockwise rotations, and negative angles correspond to clockwise rotations. (This is reversed in [navigation with bearings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(navigation)).)

    lines(c(i,i),c(-10,10),col="darkgrey",lwd=1.2)
    lines(c(-10,10),c(i,i),col="darkgrey",lwd=1.2)
}


points(x1,y1,pch=20,cex=2,col="red")
points(x2,y2,pch=20,cex=2,col="red")

xship = c(0.4,-0.3,-0.1,-0.3)*1.5
yship = c(0,0.2,0,-0.2)*1.5

xship2 = cos(th1)*xship-sin(th1)*yship
yship2 = sin(th1)*xship+cos(th1)*yship

ths = seq(th1,th1+dr,pi/180*sign(dr))
n = length(ths)
xs = 2*cos(ths)
ys = 2*sin(ths)

th = th1+dr/2
deg = th/pi*180

polygon(c(0,xs),c(0,ys),col=rgb(0,0,1,0.4),border="blue",lwd=0.4)
lines(xs,ys,col="blue",lwd=2)
text(2*cos(th),2*sin(th),paste0(sprintf("%.04f",dr)),col="blue",srt=(deg+90)%%180-90,
     adj=c(0.5-0.7*sign(cos(th)),0.5))

lines(c(0,x1),c(0,y1),col="red",lty=2)
lines(c(0,x2),c(0,y2),col="red",lty=2)
arrows(xs[n-1],ys[n-1],xs[n],ys[n],0.06,20,col="blue",lwd=2)

polygon(xship2,yship2,col=rgb(1,0.4,1),border="black",lwd=1.5)

```

The ship should turn `r round(adr,3)` radians `r wd`, so the turning angle should be `r round(dr,3)` radians.
