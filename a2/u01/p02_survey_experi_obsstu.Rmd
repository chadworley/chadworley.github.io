## Introduction

[Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) is about gathering information about the world.  We'll discuss three main ways to collect data: **Surveys**, **Experiments**, and **Observational Studies**.

## Surveys

* A [**survey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_(human_research)) gathers data by asking people questions.
* It's great for understanding opinions and feelings.
* **Example:**  What percentage of people in a town prefer apples over oranges?

> - Use a [**random sample**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample) to minimize bias. A representative sample allows us to conclude that the sample statistics are good estimates of the population parameters.
> - If you asked random people at the apple orchard, the sample would not be representative of the town.
> - Poorly worded survey questions can lead to bias.
> - "Don't you agree that apples are better than oranges?"



## Experiments

* An [**experiment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) involves randomly splitting a sample into groups, and the experimenter actively engages with the groups differently.
* Different groups receive different treatments, but everything else is consistent between the groups.
* We compare the outcomes to see if the treatment has an effect.

**Key Elements:**

* **Treatment Group:** Receives the treatment.
* **Control Group:** Receives no treatment or a standard treatment.

**Example:** Does a new fertilizer increase tomato yield?

## Observational Studies

* An [**observational study**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study) observes data without changing anything.
* **Randomness** in selecting subjects is important to reduce bias. A representative sample allows us to conclude the patterns in the sample are likely in the population.
* **Example:** Is there a connection between coffee consumption and sleep?

**Important Note:** Observational studies can directly establish correlation, but not causation.


## Correlation vs. Causation

* [**Correlation:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) Two things happen together.
* [**Causation:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality) One thing directly causes another.

**Example:**  When ice cream sales increase, there tends to be a rise in crime rates.  Does ice cream cause crime?

> - **No!** The lurking variable is **temperature**. In the summer, more people buy ice cream. I'm not sure why higher temperatures lead to higher crime. Usually the example is ice cream and drownings.

## Lurking Variables

* Lurking variables are hidden factors that influence both observed variables.

**Examples:**

> - When there are more firefighters at an on-fire building, the extent of fire damage tends to be worse. So, more firefighters cause worse damage?
> - The lurking variable is the **severity of the fire**. A more severe fire will bring more firefighters and cause more damage.
> - Kids with larger shoe size tend to have higher reading ability. So, buying oversized shoes will help my kids read?
> - The lurking variable is **age**. As kids get older, their shoe size grows and their reading level increases.

## Reversal of Causation

* **Example:** When windmills rotate faster then there's more wind.  Does the windmill cause the wind?

> - **No!** Windmills are designed to harness wind energy. The wind causes the windmill to spin.


## Experiments Establish Causation

* By controlling for other factors, experiments can isolate the effect of the treatment.
* **This is the best way to prove causation.**

> - Sometimes experiments are impossible. For example, how do scientists establish a causal link between CO2 in the atmosphere and warming temperatures?
> - See [causal analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_analysis).

## Summary

| Method | Description | Can show causation? |
|---|---|---|
| Survey | Asks people questions | No |
| Experiment | Manipulates a treatment | Yes |
| Observational Study | Observes without changing anything | No |

* Understanding these methods is essential for interpreting data and drawing valid conclusions.
