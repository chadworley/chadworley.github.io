# Turn and talk

* For each question, is it clear what would be measured?
    * For a proportion, it should be a number between 0 and 1, calculated by taking the part count and dividing by the whole count.
        * For example, if you flip 100 coins, you expect the proportion to be near 0.5.
    * For a mean, you need a bunch of measurements, where each measurement is a length, mass, time, count, energy, power, voltage, resistance, hue, etc...
* Does each question suggest a study that the student could carry out in a couple weeks?
    * The study should not involve just looking up data.
    * The student should actively gather the measurements.
* What are your strongest research questions?
* What are your weakest research questions?
