Question
========

*S-IC.B.3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.*

There is a key difference between experiments and observational studies. In an experiment, the scientist actively engages with one group differently than another. Ideally, only one small element is altered between the groups, to isolate the effects of changing the independent variable. This allows an experiment to conclude that the change in the independent variable **caused** the difference in outcomes.

In an observational study, the researcher merely measures variables, without actively changing one variable. Because of this, an observational study merely establishes a **correlation**.

In each scenario below, a research question is presented. Two methodologies are shown. Decide which methodology could lead to a cause-effect conclusion, and which methodology would be limited to showing a correlation.
