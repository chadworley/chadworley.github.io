<p><em>S-IC.A.1: Understand statistics as a process for making inferences to be made about population parameters based on a random sample from that population.</em></p>
<h3 id="background-and-future-connections">Background and future connections</h3>
<p>Below are some important definitions:</p>

<li>Sample: A smaller group taken from the population.</li>

<p>In Statistics, we learn a process for making inferences about population parameters based
on a random sample from that population. For a simple parameter, like an average or proportion, the sample statistic will be a best-guess estimate for the corresponding population parameter (for estimating the population’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviation</a>, we will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction">Bessel’s correction</a> to find a best-guess estimate from the sample). Later, we will also learn how to express the amount of uncertainty in the estimation.

<p><em>S-IC.B.3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.</em></p>
<h3 id="background-and-future-connections">Background and future connections</h3>
<p>You are expected to differentiate between surveys, experiments, and observational studies. I’ve produced some definitions below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Survey: Data is gathered by asking (randomly selected) individuals about their traits, actions, or views.</li>
<li>Experiment: A sample is (randomly) divided into groups. Each group receives a different treatment, and the effects are compared. Ideally, one group is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups">control</a>.</li>
<li>Observational Study: Researchers measure or observe (randomly selected) individuals without influencing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I think there can be overlap between surveys and the other two. For example, you could run an experiment by sending two different surveys out to random people to investigate the way wording influences responses. Don’t worry, I didn’t make any tricky scenarios like that in this question.</p>
<p>But there is a super important difference between experiments and observational studies. In an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study">observational study</a>, the goal is to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation">correlations</a> between variables. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation">CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION</a>! In order to prove <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality">causation</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment">experiment</a> must be run, ideally a doubly-blind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial">randomized controlled experiment</a>. These randomized controlled experiments were essential for bringing medicine from witchcraft to modern, beginning around 1900, which is also around the time that Statistics was developed. In fact, in case it is not clear by now, scientific research and Statistics are deeply intertwined.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-1">Scenario 1</h3>
<p>A doctor wanted to compare the effectiveness of two different pain relief medications. They divided patients with pain into two groups, each receiving a different medication. They then measured patients’ pain levels using a validated scale, comparing the results between the groups to determine which medication provided better pain relief.</p>

<h3 id="background-and-future-connections">Background and future connections</h3>
<p>You are expected to differentiate between surveys, experiments, and observational studies. I’ve produced some definitions below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Survey: Data is gathered by asking (randomly selected) individuals about their traits, actions, or views.</li>
<li>Experiment: A sample is (randomly) divided into groups. Each group receives a different treatment, and the effects are compared. Ideally, one group is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups">control</a>.</li>
<li>Observational Study: Researchers measure or observe (randomly selected) individuals without influencing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I think there can be overlap between surveys and the other two. For example, you could run an experiment by sending two different surveys out to random people to investigate the way wording influences responses. Don’t worry, I didn’t make any tricky scenarios like that in this question.</p>

<p><em>S-IC.B.3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.</em></p>
<p>When choosing who to survey, test, or observe, it is important the sample is representative of the population. The ideal method is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample">simple random sample</a>, but sometimes a true simple random sample is difficult to achieve in practice.

<p>There is a key difference between experiments and observational studies. In an experiment, the scientist actively engages with one group differently than another.

<p><em>S-IC.B.3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.</em></p>
<p>There is a key difference between experiments and observational studies. In an experiment, the scientist actively engages with one group differently than another. Ideally, only one small element is altered between the groups, to isolate the effects of changing the independent variable. This allows an experiment to conclude that the change in the independent variable <strong>caused</strong> the difference in outcomes.</p>
<p>In an observational study, the researcher merely measures variables, without actively changing one variable. Because of this, an observational study merely establishes a <strong>correlation</strong>.</p>
<p>In each scenario below, a research question is presented. Two methodologies are shown. Decide which methodology could lead to a cause-effect conclusion, and which methodology would be limited to showing a correlation.</p>
