Question
========

*S-IC.B.3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.*

### Background

You are expected to differentiate between surveys, experiments, and observational studies. I've produced some definitions below.

* Survey: Data is gathered by asking (randomly selected) individuals about their traits, actions, or views.
* Experiment: A sample is (randomly) divided into groups. Each group receives a different treatment, and the effects are compared. Ideally, one group is a [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups).
* Observational Study: Researchers measure or observe (randomly selected) individuals without influencing them.

Personally, I think there can be overlap between surveys and the other two. For example, you could run an experiment by sending two different surveys out to random people to investigate the way wording influences responses. Don't worry, I didn't make any tricky scenarios like that in this question.

But there is a super important difference between experiments and observational studies. In an [observational study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study), the goal is to find [correlations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) between variables. However, [CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation)! In order to prove [causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality), an [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) must be run, ideally a doubly-blind [randomized controlled experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial). These randomized controlled experiments were essential for bringing medicine from witchcraft to modern, beginning around 1900, which is also around the time that Statistics was developed. In fact, in case it is not clear by now, scientific research and Statistics are deeply intertwined.
