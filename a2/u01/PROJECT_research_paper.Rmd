## Project Description

### Overview

* This is a research project focused on collecting data through surveys or experiments. You, eventually, will write a 2-page paper reporting **one** of the four types:

    * Estimate a proportion. Get confidence interval and margin of error with a [bootstrap resampling method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)).
    * Estimate a mean. Get confidence interval and margin of error with a [bootstrap resampling method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)).
    * Test for a difference of two proportions with an approximate [permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_test). 
    * Test for a difference of two means with an approximate [permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_test).

* You need to **generate the data**. I recommend using surveys (google forms), biological measurements (weights of pine cones), dexterity-based challenges (free throws), or videogames. But there are plenty of other potential sources of data. However, importantly, you'll need to explain why you picked your research question.

### Research Questions Examples

#### Estimate Proportion
1. What proportion of students prefer studying in quiet environments over busy environments?
2. How many students have experienced a plant growing faster when watered with fertilizer versus just water?
3. What proportion of students believe that studying with music helps their concentration?

#### Estimate Mean
1. What is the average number of hours students spend studying for science subjects each week?
2. How much water do students drink on average in a day?
3. What is the average number of physical activities students engage in each week?

#### Test for Cause-Effect Relationship (Difference of Proportions)
1. Does exposing plants to direct sunlight cause a higher proportion of plants to thrive compared to those kept in the shade?
2. Does using different types of fertilizer cause a higher proportion of seeds to sprout compared to not using any fertilizer?
3. Does providing an interactive study guide cause a higher proportion of students to achieve higher scores on a test compared to a traditional study guide?

#### Test for Cause-Effect Relationship (Difference of Means)
1. Does the type of music played in the background affect the average speed at which students solve math problems?
2. Does leading a morning exercise routine cause an increase in the average number of questions answered correctly in a science quiz later in the day?
3. Does the use of blue light-blocking glasses cause a difference in the average number of hours students sleep compared to those who do not use them?

### Study Design Examples

#### For Estimating Proportions or Means
1. **Research Question:** What proportion of students believe that studying with music helps their concentration?
   - **Design:** Conduct a survey where students indicate whether they believe music aids their study concentration. Sample diverse classes to gain a representative view.
   - **Data Analysis:** Use bootstrap resampling to generate a confidence interval and margin of error for the proportion of students who believe in the effect of music on concentration.

2. **Research Question:** What is the average number of hours students spend studying for science subjects each week?
   - **Design:** Distribute a survey asking students to track their study hours for science subjects over a week.
   - **Data Analysis:** Use bootstrap resampling methods to estimate the mean and margin of error for study hours.

#### For Testing Cause-Effect Relationships
1. **Research Question:** Does exposing plants to direct sunlight cause a higher proportion of plants to thrive compared to those kept in the shade?
   - **Design:** Randomly assign plants to two groups: one group is placed in direct sunlight and the other in the shade. Observe their growth over a few weeks.
   - **Data Analysis:** Use a permutation test to assess the significance of the difference in growth success rates between the two groups.

2. **Research Question:** Does the type of music played in the background affect the average speed at which students solve math problems?
   - **Design:** Randomly assign students to complete math problems in two different environments: one with music and one without. Measure the time taken to complete the problems.
   - **Data Analysis:** Conduct a permutation test to determine if there is a significant difference in the average time taken to solve problems between the two groups.

This project description presents clear, viable research questions and study designs tailored for students, ensuring their ability to explore fundamental concepts in biology and physics while employing appropriate statistical methods.
