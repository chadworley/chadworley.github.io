## Project Description

### Overview

* This is a research project focused on collecting data through surveys, experiments, or observations. Your long-term goal is to **make a report** on one of the following:

    * Estimate a proportion. Get confidence interval and margin of error with a [bootstrap resampling method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)).
    * Estimate a mean. Get confidence interval and margin of error with a [bootstrap resampling method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)).
    * Test for a difference of two proportions with an approximate [permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_test). 
    * Test for a difference of two means with an approximate [permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_test).
    * Test whether a single proportion or mean is significantly different from a basic, boring ([null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis)) model by simulating the model and comparing it to the observed proportion or mean.

* You need to **generate the data**. Each datum in your data should take at least a few seconds to measure, and you need to record the measurements one at a time. You will need raw data, and you can't just find the raw data online.
* I recommend using surveys (google forms), biological measurements (weights of pine cones), dexterity-based challenges (free throws), or videogames. Of course, there are plenty other options. 
* You'll need to explain why you picked your research question. Ideally your research question will relate to a hobby or interest.

### Research Questions Examples

#### Estimate Proportion

1. What proportion of spins of a coin (on edge, on table, like a top) land heads?
2. What proportion of trees have orange/yellow leaves?
3. What proportion of students believe that studying with music helps their concentration?
4. What proportion of free throws do you make (during calm conditions)?

#### Estimate Mean

1. What is the average hours of sleep for a high-school students on a school night?
2. What is the average number of bounces when you skip a rock on a lake?
3. What is the average weight of an apple?
4. What is your average number of deaths in a round of free-for-all videogame session?
5. What is the average weight of bird seed eaten from a feeder per day?

#### Test for Difference of Proportions

1. Does strategy influence the proportion of wins in a computer game?
2. Does using a fertilizer cause a higher proportion of seeds to sprout compared to not using any fertilizer?
3. Does shooting right/left handed cause a difference in proportion of freethrows made? (Or does changing the person alter the proportion made?)
4. 

#### Test for Difference of Means

1. Does the type of music played in the background affect the average number of listener's deaths in a round of free-for-all?
2. Does one lure catch more fish per hour than another lure?
3. Do different shoes change the average time to run 100 meters?
4. Can you accomplish two tasks simultaneously faster than the same two tasks sequentially? (You have to try your hardest in all cases.)

#### Test for Single Mean or Proportion

1. Based on wins and losses (and hopefully not too many ties) from 30 games of chess, can you conclude one player is better?
2. After throwing 50 darts, can you conclude whether you tend to throw right or left of center?
3. Can you make an unfair die and show it is unfair with 100 rolls?


### Study Design Examples

#### Estimating a Parameter
1. **Research Question:** What proportion of students believe that studying with music helps their concentration?
   - **Design:** Conduct a survey where students indicate whether they believe music aids their study concentration. Sample diverse classes to gain a representative view.
   - **Data Analysis:** Use bootstrap resampling to generate a confidence interval and margin of error for the proportion of students who believe in the effect of music on concentration.

2. **Research Question:** What is the average number of hours students spend studying for science subjects each week?
   - **Design:** Distribute a survey asking students to track their study hours for science subjects over a week.
   - **Data Analysis:** Use bootstrap resampling methods to estimate the mean and margin of error for study hours.

#### Difference of Parameters
1. **Research Question:** Does exposing plants to direct sunlight cause a higher proportion of plants to thrive compared to those kept in the shade?
   - **Design:** Randomly assign plants to two groups: one group is placed in direct sunlight and the other in the shade. Observe their growth over a few weeks.
   - **Data Analysis:** Use a permutation test to assess the significance of the difference in growth success rates between the two groups.

2. **Research Question:** Does the type of music played in the background affect the average speed at which students solve math problems?
   - **Design:** Randomly assign students to complete math problems in two different environments: one with music and one without. Measure the time taken to complete the problems.
   - **Data Analysis:** Conduct a permutation test to determine if there is a significant difference in the average time taken to solve problems between the two groups.
