<p><em>S-IC.B.3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.</em></p>
<p>When choosing who to survey, test, or observe, it is important the sample is representative of the population. The ideal method is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample">simple random sample</a>, but sometimes a true simple random sample is difficult to achieve in practice. Other methods can introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias">selection bias</a>, where the population is unevenly sampled, so the sample is not representatitve of the population.</p>
<p>In each of the scenarios below, identify which sampling method would be more biased and which is closer to a simple random sample (unbiased).</p>
