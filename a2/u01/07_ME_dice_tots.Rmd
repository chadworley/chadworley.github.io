Question
========

*S-IC.A.2: Decide if a specified model is consistent with results from a given data-generating process, e.g., using simulation.*

In [table-top role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) it is common to use [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation). As an example, if a spell deals `r n`d`r d` damage, the player will roll `r cn` `r d`-sided dice (where each die follows a [discrete uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution) between 1 and `r d`) and add all the [pips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(counting)).

In a spreadsheet, you can "roll" a single `r d`-sided die with [``=RANDBETWEEN(1,`r d`)``](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093507?hl=en).
