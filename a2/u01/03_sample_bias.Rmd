Question
========

*S-IC.B.3: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.*

When choosing who to survey, test, or observe, it is important the sample is representative of the population. The ideal method is a [simple random sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample), but sometimes a true simple random sample is difficult to achieve in practice. Other methods can introduce [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias), where the population is unevenly sampled, so the sample is not representatitve of the population.

In each of the scenarios below, identify which sampling method would be more biased and which is closer to a simple random sample (unbiased).
