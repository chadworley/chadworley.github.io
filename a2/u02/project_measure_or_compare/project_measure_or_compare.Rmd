title: "Project Measure or Compare"

You will:

* Ask research question.
* Collect data.
* Perform statistical analysis.
* Write detailed report, including a conclusion.

# Ask Research Question

Your research question should relate to something you find interesting. Maybe you like videogames, sports, nature, psychology, or paper airplanes. Your research question should be about something you personally connect to.

You research question should also be "answerable" by **measuring a mean** (or proportion) or **comparing two means** (or two proportions). You will be expected to actually gather these measurements in about a week.

Here are some examples:

1. "Can I build a paper airplane that travels farther (on average) than my friend's?"
2. "Am I significantly better than my friend at a videogame?"
3. "What proportion of drivers passing BART are holding a cell phone?"
4. "What is my probability of making a freethrow?"
5. "Do country songs have a different average tempo than R&B songs?"
6. "What is the average number of letters per word in a book?"
7. "Does [an overnight soaking](https://www.primarythemepark.com/2020/03/growing-beans-in-the-classroom/) (versus a 1-hour soaking) cause beans to germinate faster?"

# Collect Data

You will collect the data by getting measurements one at a time. You will not simply copy statistics or data lists from the internet.

It is important to consider whether your sample is representative of the larger population(s) you are examining. The ideal is a simple random sample, where each entity from the population is equally likely to be selected.

Let's say we wish to examine the question, "What proportion of drivers have a phone in their hand as they pass BART?" Well, the population is every car that has ever or will ever pass BART (maybe this year). However, it is impractical for you to randomly sample from all those cars. You are limited to the next week and very limited in what time of day you can stand outside peering into cars. You'll also run into complications because not every car will be easy to check. Some will have illegally dark-tinted windows or lifted too high to check.

It will be important to discuss ways in which your sample is not a true simple random sample. You should discuss why this might alter how representative your sample is of the larger population.


# Perform Statistical Analysis

Your statistical analysis depends on whether you measured a single mean or are comparing two means.

## Analysis if you measure single mean (or single proportion)

You will produce two confidence intervals:

* Confidence interval from [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)). (See [u02_05_resample_mean_ME](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u02/outhtml/05_resample_mean_ME.html).)
* Confidence interval from the formula: $\bar{x}\pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}$. (See [u02_07_CI_mean_raw](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u02/outhtml/07_CI_mean_raw.html).)

Remember, each confidence interval is two numbers. Each confidence interval will have a lower boundary and an upper boundary.

We expect the two methods to produce similar confidence intervals. You will be expected to make a final conclusion about the population mean or population proportion you are estimating. It'll be something like, "I am 95% confident the population mean is between $a$ and $b$." However, change "population mean" to match what you are measuring.


## Analysis if you compare two means

You will produce two $p$-values:

* Get a $p$-value from [an approximate permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_test#Monte_Carlo_testing). (See [u02_09_reshuffle_two_mean](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u02/outhtml/09_reshuffle_two_mean.html).) This type of test is also called a Monte Carlo permutation test or a random permutation test. Feel free to call it any of those 3 names, whichever you feel is coolest.
* Get a $p$-value from a [Welch's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test#Software_implementations). (See [u02_10_hyptest_2_means_data](https://chadworley.github.io/a2/u02/outhtml/10_hyptest_2_means_data.html).)

Both $p$-values will probably be close to each other. Compare them to the standard cut-off 0.05. If your $p$-values are less than 0.05, you can conclude the difference is significant. Otherwise, the difference is not significant.

# Write Detailed Report

Your report will have 3 sections:

* Research Question
    * Tell the story for why you picked your research question.
* Data Acquisition
    * How did you get a simple random sample (or two simple random samples)?
    * Where did you fall short of this ideal?
    * What were the data? (Link or include the raw data.)
* Analysis
    * Do the statistical analysis.
    * Summarize and link a spreadsheet to show your work.
    * Give the confidence intervals or the p-values from both methods (resampling and formulaic).
* Conclusion
    * Make a conclusion. 
        * If you measured a single mean, explain that your sample is representative of a larger population. Make a claim about the larger population's mean.
        * If you compared two means, explain whether you can conclude the two means are significantly different. 

Your target audience is someone who does not know the project description. Your audience is also someone who barely remembers statistics (like they probably know mean means average but they are kind of confused about standard deviation, and they probably never learned anything about resampling methods). I'm thinking... a college admissions committee member or someone at your portfolio presentation.

**Grading Criteria** | **Excellent (4 pts)** | **Good (3 pts)** | **Fair (2 pts)** | **Needs Improvement (1 pt)**
---|---|---|---|---|
**Research Question** | Clear, specific, testable, and relevant to the student's interests. | Clear and testable, but may lack specificity or personal connection. | Vague, not testable, or poorly connected to the student's interests. | Unclear, not testable, and irrelevant.
**Data Acquisition** |  Data is collected from a representative sample and efforts to achieve random sampling are described. | Data is collected, but may not be fully representative of the population.  Efforts to achieve random sampling are not well explained. | Data collection methods are not described or do not result in a meaningful sample. | Data is not collected or is irrelevant to the research question.
**Data Analysis** |  Both methods (resampling and formulaic) are correctly applied, and results are accurately presented. |  One or both methods are applied with minor errors, or results are not clearly presented. |  Methods are not correctly applied, or results are poorly presented. |  No attempt to apply methods or present results.
**Conclusions** |  Concise and well-supported conclusions are drawn from the analysis.  Connections are made to the research question and the context of the sample. | Conclusions are generally supported by the analysis but lack specificity or clarity. | Conclusions are not supported by the analysis or are not well-explained. |  No conclusions are drawn.
**Presentation** |  Report is well-organized, clear, and easy to understand.  Spreadsheet is well-designed and effectively presents the data and analysis. | Report is generally well-organized, but may lack clarity or consistency in presentation. | Report is disorganized, difficult to understand, or the spreadsheet is poorly designed. |  Report is poorly organized and difficult to understand.
