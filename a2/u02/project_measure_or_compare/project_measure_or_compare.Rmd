You will:

* Ask research question.
* Collect data.
* Perform statistical analysis.
* Write detailed report.

# Ask Research Question

Your research question should relate to something you find interesting. Maybe you like videogames, sports, nature, psychology, or paper airplanes. Your research question should be about something you personally connect to.

You research question should also be "answerable" by measuring a mean (or proportion) or comparing two means (or two proportions). You will be expected to actually get these measurements in about a week.

Here are some examples:

1. "Can I build a paper airplane that travels farther (on average) than my friend's?"
2. "Am I significantly better than my friend at a videogame?"
3. "What proportion of cars that enter Adams stop in Adams before leaving Adams?"
4. "What is my probability of sinking a freethrow?"
5. "Do country songs have a different average tempo than R&B songs?"
6. "What is the average number of letters per word in a book?"
7. "Does [an overnight soaking](https://www.primarythemepark.com/2020/03/growing-beans-in-the-classroom/) (versus a 1-hour soaking) cause beans to germinate faster?"

# Collect Data

You will collect the data by getting measurements one at a time. You will not simply copy statistics or data lists from the internet.

# Perform Statistical Analysis

Depending on your question, you will either **produce a confidence interval** or **test a null hypothesis**. If you measure a mean or a proportion, you will produce a confidence interval. If you compare two means or two proportions, you will test the null hypothesis, where the null suggests that both means (or proportions) are equivalent.

Your analysis should be done twice:

* Once with resampling ([bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)) for a confidence interval or [permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_test) for a hypothesis test)
* And once with formulas ($\bar{x}\pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}$ for a confidence interval or [Welch's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test#Software_implementations) for hypothesis test)
