* Correct order of sections:
    * Summary
    * Simulation
        * description of simulation
        * histogram
        * interval of typical proportions (and how determined)
        * simulated margin of error (and how determined)
        * formulaic margin of error (and how determined)
    * Sample
        * Description of how data is collected
        * The sample statistics (sample size, success count, and proportion)
    * Analysis
        * Compare the sample proportion to the simulated proportions
        * Conclude. What can you say about spinning pennies?
