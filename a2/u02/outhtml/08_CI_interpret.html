<br><h4>Question</h4><button onclick='prev.call(this)'>prev</button><button onclick='next.call(this)'>next</button>
<p>A scientist collects a sample (with sample size <span class="math inline">\(n=206\)</span>) from a population. Each individual’s weight is measured, and summary statistics are calculated: <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}=33.9\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s=7.8\)</span>. The scientist calculates a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight (in grams).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{confidence interval} = \left[32.8,\, 35\right] \]</span></p>
<p>A correct interpretation is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If the same population were sampled repeatedly, and each time a confidence interval was calculated, then the sample mean will be between the boundaries approximately 95% of the time.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is measured repeatedly, it will be between these boundaries (32.8 and 35) approximately 95% of the time.</li>
<li>If the entire process of gathering the sample and calculating the confidence interval is repeated, there is a 95% chance that <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> will be between the new boundaries.</li>

<p>Correct answer: “If the entire process of gathering the sample and calculating the confidence interval is repeated, there is a 95% chance that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> will be between the new boundaries.”</p>
<p>Check the meaning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval" target="_blank">confidence interval</a>.</p>
<p>Notice the meaning is quite subtle and confusing. Most importantly a confidence interval allows us to indicate our uncertainty of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. We have a pretty good guess (<span class="math inline">\(\mu \approx \bar{x}\)</span>), and we have an idea that it’s probably not further off than the margin of error (<span class="math inline">\(\text{ME}\approx \frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span>).</p>
