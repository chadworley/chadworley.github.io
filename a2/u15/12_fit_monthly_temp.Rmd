Question
========

In Maedupton, the monthly average temperatures approximately follow a sinusoidal function. The last three years of data (starting in January of 2022 and ending with December of 2024) are shown below.  

| Month | Average Temp (Â°F) |
|:---:|:---:|
`r ccc`

1. Copy the data into [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator). The data should automatically fill a table.
2. Click the `Add Regression` button near the top-left of the table. The icon looks like a bunch of dots with a line through them.
3. Switch the regression to `Sinusoidal Regression`. It will automatically use a 4-parameter sine function ([amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude), [angular frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency), horizontal shift, and vertical shift).

$$y=A\sin(Bt-C)+D$$
$$\begin{aligned}
A&=\text{amplitude} \\
B&=\text{angular frequency} \\
C&=\text{phase shift} \\
D&=\text{vertical shift (offset)} \\ &\phantom{=}\text{ midline is at } y=D
\end{aligned}$$

In this scenario, $D$ represents our best guess for the yearly average temperature of Maedupton, and $A$ represents how much the winter/summer monthly averages get above or below $D$.

The relationship between angular frequency ($B$) and period ($P$) is reciprocal:
$$P=\frac{2\pi}{B}$$
We expect the period to be 12 months, so we expect $B$ to be $\frac{2\pi}{12}\approx `r pi/6`$. Notice that with the limited data, the fit will not give that value exactly. It would be reasonable to force $B$ to equal $\pi/6$ exactly, and it is possible to do that in Desmos, but let's not worry about that for this problem.

Lastly, parameter $C$ simply shifts our curve horizontally. Since we are using a sine function, but our data start near their minimum, we shift the curve about 1/4 of the period. Notice, your fitted value of $C$ will be near $\pi/2\approx`r pi/2`$ (quarter circle in radians), but since January or February is the coldest month (not December), $C$ will probably be a bit more than $\pi/2$.

4. Using the curve of best fit, predict the average temperature in `r mnth` of 2025.



Solution
========

`r mnth` of 2025 would be month number `r xp`.

Your fit should give the following values for the parameters:

$$A=`r cf[1]`$$
$$B=`r cf[2]`$$
$$C=`r cf[3]`$$
$$D=`r cf[4]`$$

So your best-fit curve is:
$$f(t)~=~`r round(cf[1],5)`\cdot \sin(`r round(cf[2],5)`t-`r round(cf[3],5)`)+`r round(cf[4],5)`$$

We want to determine $f(`r xp`)$.

$$f(`r xp`)~=~`r cf[1]*sin(cf[2]*xp-cf[3])+cf[4]`$$

In Desmos, you can click and drag on the curve until the horizontal coordinate equals `r xp` and read off the vertical coordinate.


Alternatively, in the regression box, near the word `EQUATION`, click on the icon of an arrow pointing into a notebook. If you hover over the icon is says `Export a snapshot to the expression list`. After you export the expression, you can alter the $y=$ to $f(x)=$. In another expression, you can then write $f(`r xp`)$.
