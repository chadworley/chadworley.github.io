The canonical example of [simple harmonic motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion) is a mass-spring system. A lightweight spring is attached to a ceiling, and a heavy mass is attached to the dangling end. By using placing the mass-spring system close to a marked wall, and by using a camera with a long [focal length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length#In_photography), the position (in meters above floor) of the mass was tracked over time (in seconds).
