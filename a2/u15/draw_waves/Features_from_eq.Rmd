* If $y=A\sin(Bt)+D$ then
    * amplitude = $|A|$
    * angular frequency = $B$
    * frequency = $\frac{B}{2\pi}$
    * period = $\frac{2\pi}{B}$
    * offset = $D$, so midline is at $y=D$
    * If $A>0$ then at $t=0$ the wave is at midline and increasing
    * If $A<0$ then at $t=0$ the wave is at midline and decreasing
    
* If $y=A\cos(Bt)+D$ then
    * amplitude = $|A|$
    * angular frequency = $B$
    * frequency = $\frac{B}{2\pi}$
    * period = $\frac{2\pi}{B}$
    * offset = $D$, so midline is at $y=D$
    * If $A>0$ then at $t=0$ the wave is at maximum
    * If $A<0$ then at $t=0$ the wave is at minimum
