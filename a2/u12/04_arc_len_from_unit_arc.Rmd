Question
========

Two concentric circles have radii $r_1=1$ meters and $r_2=`r R`$ meters. A central angle subtends [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)) arcs on both circles: a blue arc on the smaller circle and a red arc on the larger circle. The blue arc length is `r L1` meters, as shown in the diagram below.


```{r,echo=F,fig.dim=c(7,7)}

par(mar=c(0,0,0,0),pty="s")

What is the length, in meters, of the red arc? *The tolerance is set to $\pm0.01$ meters.*

Solution
========

Okay, this might seem absurdly easy if you are comfortable with [similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)).

$$\frac{1}{`r L1`} ~=~ \frac{`r R`}{?}$$

$$?~=~ `r L1`\cdot `r R` ~=~ `r L2`$$

I am trying to introduce the **[radian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian)**, which is the arc length of a unit circle. 

* Massachusetts learning objective F-TF.A.1:
    * Understand radian measure of an angle as the length of the arc on the unit circle subtended by the angle.
    
In this case, the central angle is `r deg`Â°, which is approximately equivalent to `r round(ang,2)` radians. To convert between degrees and radians, we can multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}$ to go from degrees to radians or multiply by $\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}$ to convert from radians to degrees.

As you progress in math, you'll use **radians** by default, not degrees. One of the best reasons for this depends on concepts learned in calculus... but in short... if we use radians, then the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) of $\sin(x)$ is simply $\cos(x)$. If we used degrees, then calculus with trigonometric functions would be more annoying.

If you look up [circular arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_arc#Length) on wikipedia, you'll see a formula relating the arc length ($L$) to radius ($r$) and the central angle **measured in radians** ($\theta$).
$$L~=~r\theta$$

So, in our case:

$$L~=~(`r R`)(`r L1`)$$

$$L~=~`r R*L1`~\text{m}$$
