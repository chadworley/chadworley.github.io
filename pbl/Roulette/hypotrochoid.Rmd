A [hypotrochoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotrochoid) is made by a circle rolling around inside another circle without slipping. Today we will practice generating hypotrochoids using circular gears.



\newpage


* Stationary gear (inside of circle): 105
* Moving gear: 60
* Simplify the fraction $\frac{105}{60}~=~\frac{7}{4}$
