Some quantity ($y$) is varying in time ($t$), following a temporal [sinusoidal function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave) parameterized with 4 parameters:

$$y(t) ~=~ A\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P}(t+L)\right)+D$$

* Amplitude $A$, where $A>0$
  * Amplitude is the "vertical stretch" factor.
  * A negative $A$ would cause a vertical reflection. However, an equivalent transformation would be caused by shifting "horizontally" (in time) by half a period, so there is no loss of generality by forcing $A$ to be positive.
  * The amplitude might indicate changes in pressure, position, temperature, or many other types of quantities.
  * The [wikipedia article on amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude#Semi-amplitude) refers to $A$ as the semi-amplitude.
* Period $P$, where $P>0$
  * Period is a "horizontal stretch" factor.
  * Another symbol, $T$, is often used for period.
  * Period has units of time, typically seconds.
  * The [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) is the reciprocal of $P$, so $f=\frac{1}{P}$. Frequency has units of [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz).
  * The [angular frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency) $\omega$ is equivalent to the quotient, so $\omega~=~\frac{2\pi}{P}~=~2\pi f$
  * If the independent variable is spatial rather than temporal, the analogous term to "period" is "[wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength)"; often $\lambda$ is used for wavelength.
  * Most physical waves (like sound and light) vary in space and time, so they have both wavelength and period, which are related by the speed ($v$) of the wave: $v=\frac{\lambda}{P}$
* Leftward shift $L$, where $0\le L<P$. All points along the sine function are shifted backwards (in time) by $L$.
  * When $t=0$, it is kind of like $L$ time has already passed (compared to the parent sine function).
  * Like $A$, the parameter $L$ does not need to be constrained (between 0 and $P$), but any sinusoidal wave can be generated with this constraint.
  * This parameter, $L$, has units of time.
  * Many textbooks will incorrectly/confusingly refer to this as the "phase shift".
  * The [phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)) shift, $\phi$, has units of radians: $\phi=\frac{2\pi L}{P}$.
* [Vertical shift]((https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/dc_offset.html)) $D$
  * This vertical shift is called [DC offset or DC bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_bias) in sound recording.
  * The midline at $y=D$ is halfway between the [crests and troughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_and_trough).
