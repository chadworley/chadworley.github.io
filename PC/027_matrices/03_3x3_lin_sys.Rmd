`r al`
`r al`
`r al`



Solution
========

From [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/books/precalculus-2e/pages/9-2-systems-of-linear-equations-three-variables):

Given a linear system of three equations, solve for three unknowns.

* Pick any pair of equations and eliminate one variable.
* Pick another pair of equations and eliminate the same variable.
* You have created a system of two equations in two unknowns. Solve the resulting two-by-two system.
* Back-substitute known variables into any one of the original equations and solve for the missing variable.


$$x=`r x[1]`$$

$$y=`r x[2]`$$

$$z=`r x[3]`$$
