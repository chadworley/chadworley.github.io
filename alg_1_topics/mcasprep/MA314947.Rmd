Question
========

The area, in square units, of a rectangle is represented by this expression.
$$`r a*b`x^2+`r a*c`x$$

Which of the following also represents the area, in square units, of the rectangle?


Answerlist
--------

`r al`


Solution
========

Notice $`r cc`$ is equivalent is $`r orex`$. You can show this based on the [distributive property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property).

$$a(b+c) ~~\equiv~~ ab+ac$$

In this case, $a=`r a`x$ and $b=`r b`x$ and $c=`r c`$.
