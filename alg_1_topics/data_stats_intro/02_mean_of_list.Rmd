```{r,data,generation,echo=FALSE,results="hide"}
while(T){
  tens = sample(2:9,1)
  n = sample(4:6,1)
  x = sample((tens*10):(tens*10+9),n)
  xbar = mean(x)
  if(xbar != round(xbar) && xbar==round(xbar,2)){break}
}
```


Question
========

Find [the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) of the following list:
$$`r x`$$

(Do not round your answer.)


Solution
========

Divide the total by the count.

$$\frac{`r paste0(x,collapse="+")`}{`r n`} = `r xbar`$$

I'll point out that you could recognize that all numbers have in the `r tens*10`s. To simplify the arithmetic, you could instead just find the average of the ones digits and add `r tens*10`:
$$`r tens*10`+\frac{`r paste0(x%%10,collapse="+")`}{`r n`} ~=~ `r xbar`$$
