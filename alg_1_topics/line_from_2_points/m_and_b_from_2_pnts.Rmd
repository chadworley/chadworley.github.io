Question
========


A line goes through two points: $(`r x1`, `r y1`)$ and $(`r x2`, `r y2`)$. Find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.

$y =$ ##ANSWER1##$x$ ##ANSWER2##

Answerlist
--------

`r sal1`
`r sal2`

Solution
========

Slope intercept form is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is slope and $b$ is y-intercept.

First, calculate the slope.
$$m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$

$$m = \frac{(`r y2`)-(`r y1`)}{(`r x2`)-(`r x1`)} = \frac{`r y2-y1`}{`r x2-x1`}$$

$$m=`r lal1[m==mch]`$$

Plug in the second point $(`r x2`, `r y2`)$ into the slope intercept form, leaving $b$ unknown.

$$`r y2` = \left(`r lal1[m==mch]`\right)(`r x2`)+b$$

Solve for $b$.

$$b = `r y2`-\left(`r lal1[m==mch]`\right)(`r x2`)$$

$$b=`r b`$$

So the line's equation, in slope-intercept form, is:

$$y = `r lal1[m==mch]` x `r al2[b==-5:5]`$$
