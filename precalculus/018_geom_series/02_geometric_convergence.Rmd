Question
========

An infinite geometric series converges if and only if $|r|<1$. A convergent series will approach a finite value as more terms are added; a divergent series will approach infinity. **Is the following geometric series convergent?**

$$`r gs`$$

Answerlist
--------

* Yes, the series converges.
* No, the series diverges.


Solution
========

Determine the common ratio by dividing the second term by the first term.

$$r = \frac{`r g1*r`}{`r g1`} = `r r`$$

Notice, this is the same as the ratio of the third and second terms.

$$r ~=~ \frac{`r g1*r^2`}{`r g1*r`} ~=~ `r r`$$

Determine the absolute value of the common ratio.

$$|r| ~=~ |`r r`| ~=~ `r abs(r)`$$

Compare the absolute common ratio to 1. If it is less than 1, the series converges; otherwise, the series diverges.

$$|`r r`| `r smbl` 1$$

So, **the series `r cd`.**
