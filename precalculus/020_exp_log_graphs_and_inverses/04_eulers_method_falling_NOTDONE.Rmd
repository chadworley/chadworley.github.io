h0 = 100
```


Question
========

When an object falls downward, its acceleration is influenced by two competing forces: weight ($W$) and air resistance ($kv^2$).

$$\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = -W+kv^2$$

The coefficient $k$ depends on the shape of the object and the density of the air.

Because the object is falling straight down, velocity is how fast the height is changing.

$$\frac{\Delta h}{\Delta t} = v$$

Let's set the parameters and initial values.


* Parameters:
  * $k = `r k`$
* Initial values:
  * $h(0) = `r h0`$
  * $v(0) = 0$
