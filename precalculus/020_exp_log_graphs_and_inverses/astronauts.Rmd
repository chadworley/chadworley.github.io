Question
========

Two astronauts are floating in deep space. Due to an accident, they are currently $x_0=`r x0`$ meters away with no relative velocity ($v_0 = 0$ m/s). Their combined mass is $M=`r M`$ kg. The following differential equations dictate their motion (assuming $\Delta t$ is small).

$$\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} ~=~ v$$
$$\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}~=~ \frac{-GM}{x^2}$$

where $G=6.67430\cdot 10^{−11}$	$\mathrm{N⋅m^2⋅kg^{−2}}$ is the [universal gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant).


How long will it take for the astronauts to be reunited?
