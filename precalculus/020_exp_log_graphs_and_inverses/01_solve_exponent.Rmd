Question
========

Solve:

$$`r a` = `r b`^x $$

Tolerance is $\pm0.01$.


Solution
========

Take a log of both sides.

$$\log(`r a`) = \log(`r b`^x)$$

Use the [logarithm-of-a-power identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logarithmic_identities#Logarithm_of_a_power).

$$\log(`r a`) = x \log(`r b`)$$

Divide both sides by $\log(`r b`)$.

$$\frac{\log(`r a`)}{\log(`r b`)} = x$$

Optionally, apply the [change-of-base identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logarithmic_identities#Changing_the_base).

$$x = \log_{`r b`}(`r a`)$$

Evaluate.

$$x = `r x`$$
