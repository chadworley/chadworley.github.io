Question
========

Solve:

$$`r exp1`$$


Solution
========

The sum of logs equals a log of a product. This can be expressed with an identity:

$$\log_{a}(b)+\log_a(c) ~\equiv~ \log_a(bc)$$

where $a>0$ and $a\ne 1$ and $b>0$ and $c>0$. Based on knowing your multiplication table, it should be easy to apply the identity.


$$\log_{`r a[3]`}(`r a[1]`)+\log_{`r a[3]`}(`r a[2]`) = \log_{`r a[3]`}(`r a[1]*a[2]`) $$

So, $x=`r nums[unk]`$.
