## Week 01: Aug 21 - Aug 25

We used the dice-rolling project as an example to discuss various concepts in Statistics. When we rolled 100 standard dice, we got a total near 350, because the population mean is 3.5 for fair 6-sided dice. When we rolled 100 special dice, we got a total above 400, because those dice were weighted. We learned $z$-scores are a way to determine whether a sample's total is typical or outlandish.

If $f$ is a function and $x$ is an element of its domain, then $f(x)$ denotes the output of $f$ corresponding to the input $x$. The graph of $f$ is the graph of the equation $y = f(x)$.
