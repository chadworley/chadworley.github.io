Question
========

Let $a_{i}$ represent the $i$th element of an [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression){target="_blank"}, and
$$a_{`r n`} = `r an`$$
$$a_{`r m`} = `r am`$$

Find the common difference.


Solution
========

Start with the explicit formula.

$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d $$

Fill in the knowns, resulting in a system of 2 equations and 2 variables.

$$`r an` = a_1+(`r n`-1)d $$
$$`r am` = a_1+(`r m`-1)d $$

Simplify the parentheses.

$$`r an` = a_1+`r n-1`d $$
$$`r am` = a_1+`r m-1`d $$

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate $a_1$.

$$`r am-an` = `r m-n`d $$

Divide by `r m-n`.

$$`r round((am-an)/(m-n))` = d $$
