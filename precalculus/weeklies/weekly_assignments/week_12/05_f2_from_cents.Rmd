Question
========

A musician plays two notes. One note has a fundamental frequency of $f_1=`r f1`$ Hz. The second frequency is `r abs(C)` cents `r wrd`. **What is the second frequency?**

Remember the way to calculate an interval in cents.
$$I = 1200\cdot \log_2\left(\frac{f_2}{f_1}\right)$$

with $I$ as the ([signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics))) interval in cents, $f_1$ as the first frequency in hertz, and $f_2$ as the second frequency in hertz. We can solve the formula for $f_2$ because logarithms and exponentials are inverses.

$$f_2 = f_1 \cdot 2^{I/1200}$$


Solution
========

Use the formula. Because $f_2$ is `r abs(C)` cents `r wrd` $f_1$, then $I=`r C`$.

$$f_2 = `r f1` \cdot 2^{`r C`/1200} $$

$$f_2=`r f2`$$
