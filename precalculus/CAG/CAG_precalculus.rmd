# Unit 1: Statistics

The goal of Statistics is to systematically make inferences about populations based on samples. How do we determine whether dice are unfairly weighted? How do we determine whether a new medicine is beneficial to patients? These questions are difficult to answer because of natural variability: not every patient will die without the treatment, and not every patient will survive with the treatment.

The infinite complexity underlying the variability can be modeled using probability. We learn that probabilistic models can be useful even when the events are fully deterministic (i.e. the weather). We use random-number generators and spreadsheets to run simulations and summarize data. Our study of probability culminates in the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem}{\color{blue}central limit theorem}. 

The central limit theorem provides the foundation for (most) inferential statistics. We do not derive this connection rigorously. However, we will practice judging whether a null-hypothesis simulation is copacetic with an observation. We also practice linear regression. Students complete a project where they investigate a possible correlation, estimate a population mean, or run an experiment.

# Unit 2: Functions: notation, features, symmetries, composition, limits, average rate of change, and common parents

We introduce important notation to describe functions. Students often struggle with function notation, but it is useful for defining average rate of change, even/odd symmetries, and compositions. Limit notation is necessary in calculus (for definitions of continuity, derivatives, and integrals); students will practice using limit notation to describe end behavior and discontinuities. We also review interval notation for domain, range, increasing intervals, and decreasing intervals.

A lot of this unit hints at the idea of a derivative function (an essential concept in calculus). We will directly discuss the concept, and students will complete a project where they find the "instantaneous" rate of change of a function at various inputs by using small intervals for the average rate of change.

* Essential Questions:
  * Why is function notation useful?

# Unit 3: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Exponential growth (or decay) occurs when the rate of change is proportional to the current value (of the dependent value). This concept will be introduced with a brief introduction to [Euler's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method), using spreadsheets.

Discrete exponential growth is seen in geometric sequences. We  compare arithmetic and geometric sequences. We derive formulas for partial series and the infinite convergent geometric series. We calculate the perimeters and areas of fractals.

We learn about the financial example of compound interest, using a step function $A(t)=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{\lfloor rt\rfloor}$. We notice that as $x\to \infty$, the formula approaches $A(t)=Pe^{rt}$.
