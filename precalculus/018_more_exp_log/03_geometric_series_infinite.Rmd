Question
========

A convergent infinite geometric series has a finite sum. First, remember the geometric series formula:

$$S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r} $$

If $|r|<1$, then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}1-r^n = 1$, because repeated multiplication of a [proper fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction#Proper_and_improper_fractions) creates numbers closer and closer to 0.

So, if $|r|<1$, then

$$S_{\infty} ~=~ \frac{a}{1-r} $$

Find the sum of the following geometric series (with infinitely many terms).

$$`r gs`$$



Solution
========

Determine the common ratio by dividing the second term by the first term.

$$r = \frac{`r g1*r`}{`r g1`} = `r r`$$

Notice, this is the same as the ratio of the third and second terms.

$$r ~=~ \frac{`r g1*r^2`}{`r g1*r`} ~=~ `r r`$$

Determine the absolute value of the common ratio.

$$|r| ~=~ |`r r`| ~=~ `r abs(r)`$$

Because $|r|<1$, the series is convergent.

$$a = `r g1`$$
$$r = `r r`$$

$$S_{\infty} ~=~ \frac{a}{1-r} ~=~ \frac{`r g1`}{1-`r r`} ~=~ `r Sinf`$$
