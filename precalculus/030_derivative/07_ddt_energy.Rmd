Question
========

A bucket initially holds `r V0` liters of water. A hole is punched into the bottom of the bucket, so water leaks out following [Torricelli's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torricelli%27s_law). Below, volume is shown as a function of time, where $t$ in in minutes.

$$V(t)~=~`r ex1`$$

How fast (in liters per minute) is water leaving the bucket at $t=`r t`$ minutes? (Tolerance is $\pm 0.01$ liters per minute.)

Solution
========

We were given the volume as a function of time.

$$V(t) ~=~ `r ex1`$$

Find the derivative of the volume function (with respect to time). Use the [differentiation rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_rules#The_polynomial_or_elementary_power_rule).

$$V'(t) ~=~ (`r a`\cdot 2)t^{2-1}+(`r b`\cdot 1)t^{1-1}$$

$$V'(t) ~=~ `r ex2`$$

Plug the specified time $t=`r t`$ into the function.

$$V'(`r t`) ~=~ `r dVdt`$$

So, when $t=`r t`$, water is leaving at a rate of `r abs(dVdt)` liters per minute.
