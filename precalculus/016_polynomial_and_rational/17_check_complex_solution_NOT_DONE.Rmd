```{r}
ri = sample(c(-9:-2,2:9),2)
rp = ri[1]
ip = ri[2]
# (x-(rp+ip*i))*(x-(rp-ip*i))
# x^2-(rp-ip*i)x-(rp+ip*i)x+(rp+ip*i)(rp-ip*i)
# x^2-2*rp*x+rp^2+ip^2
a = 1
b = -2*rp
c = rp^2+ip^2

I should write a question for students to check if a complex number solves a quadratic polynomial. It suggests applying the multiplication and summation of complex numbers to see if 0.
