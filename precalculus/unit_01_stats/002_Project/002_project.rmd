Question
========

A lottery offers the following payout scheme:

| profit | chance |
|:---:|:---:|
| `r X[1]` | `r P[1]` |
| `r X[2]` | `r P[2]` |
| `r X[3]` | `r P[3]` |
| `r X[4]` | `r P[4]` |

To analyze this [discrete probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function){target="_blank"}, you can use this link: 

`r html`

A friend claims, "I have only played that lottery $n=25$ times, and I've won $\sum x = `r tot`$ dollars." You wish to judge whether your friend is making an outlandish claim. To do this, you calculate a $z$ score.

$$z = \frac{\sum x - n\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{n}}$$

A typical $z$ score is between $-2$ and $2$ (this happens 95\% of the time). A $z$ score less than $-3$ or more than $3$ is quite unlikely (less than 0.3% of the time). 

Is your friend's claim typical or outlandish? To answer this, calculate a $z$ score accurate to the hundredths place.

$$z=\,?$$


Solution
========

$$z = \frac{\sum x - n\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{n}}$$

$$z = \frac{(`r tot`)-(`r n`)(`r mu`)}{(`r sig`)\sqrt{`r n`}} $$

$$z = `r sprintf("%.2f", z)` $$
