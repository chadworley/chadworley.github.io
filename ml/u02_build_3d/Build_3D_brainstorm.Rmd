# Design & Build: Your 3D Masterpiece!

Get ready to design and build your own incredible 3D creations! This project will involve two exciting phases:

## Phase 1: Design

* Brainstorm: Think about what kind of 3D object you'd love to bring to life. Don't hold back! Let your imagination run wild.
* Sketch: Draw out your idea on paper. Include as much detail as possible, showing its shape, size, and any special features.
* Measure & Calculate: Use math to plan out your object's dimensions. How long, wide, and tall will it be?
* Document: Carefully document your design process. Include your sketches, calculations, and any resources you used.

## Phase 2: Build

* Choose Your Materials: Select the materials that best suit your design.
* Bring it to Life: Use your design and all your skills to construct your 3D object.
* Measure & Compare: Once your object is complete, carefully measure it and compare your results to your original design.

## To get you started, think about the following:

* What are some interesting shapes you'd like to explore? Think beyond basic shapes like cubes and spheres.
* What cool features would you include? Curves, angles, intricate patterns, or maybe even moving parts?
* What materials would you use? Wood, paper, clay, cardboard, fabric, or something else entirely?

**Type a list of your initial ideas below! Include as many details as you can, and don't be afraid to be creative!**

**How long do you estimate each idea would require to design and build?**
