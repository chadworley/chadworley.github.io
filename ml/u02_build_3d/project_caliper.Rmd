You have just learned how to read Vernier calipers. Your group should have a caliper and an object. Your group will produce two things:

1. A hand-drawn [schematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_drawing) with measurements/specification marked clearly.
2. A to-scale [SketchUp](https://app.sketchup.com) model. I'd recommend working in centimeters (choose centimeters when starting a new project).

Your goal is to get as accurate as possible. 

**To submit the assignment:**

1. Give the teacher your hand-drawn schematic.
2. Submit the **skp** file from your SketchUp model on canvas. (Go to Download > skp).
