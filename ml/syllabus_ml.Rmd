## Math Literacy

* Math Literacy is a project-based math class. Our goal is to develop, build, and **document** various projects with mathematical basis. The documentation is absolutely critical. I expect most documentation will take the form of a slideshow/presentation, but I am open to other media (paper/poster/video/website).
* In the documentation, it will be important to make (a few) references to mathematical concepts.
* Each project should be viewed as a possible element to your senior portfolio.
* You are expected to add your own flair into each project.

## Classroom Procedures & Expectations

* No personal electronics.
    * You will get bored. That's okay.
* Typical class:
    * Entrance ticket:
        * Usually you'll be asked for a plan/goals for day/week.
    * Lecture:
        * Review project guidelines/examples.
        * Relevant mathematical concepts.
    * Class discussions. This is time for people to propose future projects or suggest tools they've found useful.
    * Individual work time.
        * Check-ins. I will have frequent one-on-one check-ins to monitor progress.
    * Exit ticket: 
        * Usually you'll document what you accomplished that day.
* Presentations
    * Everyone will need to present a Senior Portfolio this year, so I feel everyone could use some practice. This class feels like an excellent place to practice presenting your projects. Right now, I feel like every project should be followed by a presentation.
    * If you'd prefer making a screencast, that will also be accepted. In Canvas, we have [Studio](https://bart.instructure.com/courses/1282/external_tools/65).
* Quietude:
    * Last year I struggled to keep classes quiet enough for students to focus. I felt very bad for these students who became more frustrated through the year.
    * An incredibly useful concept is [negative externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality). When individuals pursue self interests, they often cause costs onto others. Common examples are pollution (chemical or noise). A society should tax these behaviors for the betterment of the whole.
    * I am expected to maintain a calm environment conducive to learning.

## Work turn in policy

* Turn work in **ON CANVAS**. Do not send it to me in an email.

## Late Work Policy

* Each day late incurs a -2% penalty, down to -30% at the most extreme. In other words, if you hand it in $x$ days late, and you get a fraction $y$ of the points (where $y$ is between 0 and 1), then your late-adjusted fraction will be:
$$y_{\mathrm{adj}} = y-0.02 \cdot y\cdot \min(15,\,\lfloor x \rfloor)$$
But, each quarter's work will not be accepted after the quarter ends.

## Academic Honesty

* Be honest with your assignments. Cite your sources.
* If you use an AI to help you, say which one and how it was used.

## Absent Students

* If a student is absent they should get the # of days out +1 to make up the work. If a student is struggling with this they should reach out to the teacher to discuss.

## Participation

* Participation will be used as part of your effort grade.
* More importantly, please do not cause distractions.
