<br><h4>Question</h4><button onclick='prev.call(this)'>prev</button><button onclick='next.call(this)'>next</button>
<p>A electric heating unit is placed into an otherwise empty (thin) metal can with a (thin) metal lid. The can is wrapped in an insulating material (with an impermeable surface) and hung from the ceiling by a thin wire. A thermocouple is used to measure the temperature on both sides of the insulating material, and a fan is placed nearby to blow room temperature air across the insulation’s surface (to hopefully bring the outside surface temperature equal to room temperature). The heating unit is run at a constant voltage and amperage (so, constant power), and sufficient time is given until temperatures stop changing (the system has reached steady-state equilibrium).</p>
<p>Our goal is to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-value_(insulation)">R-value</a> of the insulating material. The R-value is the quotient of the product of surface area (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) times the temperature difference (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span>) divided by power (<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>).</p>

<br><h4>Question</h4><button onclick='prev.call(this)'>prev</button><button onclick='next.call(this)'>next</button>
<p>A electric heating unit is placed into an otherwise empty (thin) metal can with a (thin) metal lid. The can is wrapped in an insulating material (with an impermeable surface) and hung from the ceiling by a thin wire. A thermocouple is used to measure the temperature on both sides of the insulating material, and a fan is placed nearby to blow room temperature air across the insulation’s surface (to hopefully bring the outside surface temperature equal to room temperature). The heating unit is run at a constant voltage and amperage (so, constant power), and sufficient time is given until temperatures stop changing (the system has reached steady-state equilibrium).</p>
