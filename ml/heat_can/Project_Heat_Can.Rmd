# Overview

The goal is to design, build, and test a cheap device for measuring [thermal conductivity and resistivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity_and_resistivity) of fabrics.

# Materials

* Ruler
* Thermocouple sensor (wire lead)
* [Vacuum flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_flask)
* Plastic wrap (Saran wrap)
* USB power source (battery or [AC adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_adapter))
* USB power meter
* An old USB cable (will be cut)
* A 1-Watt, 5-Volt heating element
* A 1-Watt, 5-Volt fan
* Wiring/breadboard/tape to connect the electronics
* A box fan or similar
