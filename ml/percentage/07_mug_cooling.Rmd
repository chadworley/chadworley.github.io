```{r,echo=F,warning=F}
options(scipen=99)
thalf = runif(1,4,20)
# 1/2 = (r)^thalf
k = (1/2)^(1/thalf)
pd = round((1-k)*100,2)
k = 1-pd/100
Td0 = sample(50:99,1)
t = sample(ceiling(thalf/2):floor(thalf*3),1)

Tdf = Td0*k^t
```

Question
========

At $t=0$ minutes, a cup of coffee is `r Td0` [Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin) hotter than the surrounding air. Each minute, this amount decreases by `r pd`%. After `r t` minutes, how many Kelvin above surrounding-air temperature is the cup of coffee?


Solution
========

Find the scale factor.

$$1-`r pd/100`~=~`r k`$$

Multiply the initial amount by the scale factor `r t` times.

$$`r Td0`\cdot `r k`^{`r t`}~=~`r Tdf`$$

So, after `r t` minutes, the coffee is only `r round(Tdf)` Kelvin hotter than the surrounding air.
