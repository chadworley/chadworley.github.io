```{r,echo=F,warning=F}
options(scipen=99)
P = sample(11:99,1)/10*10^(sample(1:3,1))
k = round(runif(1,0.91,0.99),4)
r = 1-k
t = sample(3:20,1)
A = P*k^t
```

Question
========

An investment is purchased at a principal of $`r P`. Every year its worth **decreases** by `r r*100`%. What will its worth be after `r t` years?


Solution
========

$$`r P`\cdot `r k`^{`r t`}~=~`r round(A,2)`$$
