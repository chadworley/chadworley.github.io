Question
========

Solve for $x$.

$$`r ex`$$

* $x=$ 

Solution
========

I'm going to first rewrite the given equation.

$$`r ex`$$

Notice the last operation (following PEMDAS, on the side with $x$) is subtraction by `r b`. Undo this by adding `r b` to both sides.

$$`r ex2`$$

Now the last operation is division by `r a`. Undo the addition by multiplying both sides by `r a`.

$$`r ex3`$$
