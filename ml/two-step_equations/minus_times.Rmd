Question
========

Solve for $x$.

$$`r ex`$$

* $x=$ 

Solution
========

I'm going to first rewrite the given equation.

$$`r ex`$$

Notice the last operation (following PEMDAS, on the side with $x$) is multiplication by `r b`. Undo this by dividing both sides by `r b`.

$$`r ex2`$$

Now the last operation is subtraction by `r a`. Undo the addition by adding `r a` to both sides.

$$x~=~`r x`$$
