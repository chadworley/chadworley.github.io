## Assignment

* Produce at least one "wallpaper" image for each of the 17 wallpaper groups.
    * All the wallpapers should feel connected. They can share stylistic elements. Or maybe they come together to tell a story. You will eventually write an overall project statement.
* For each wallpaper, produce an artist's statement. Each statement should include specifics.
    * What symmetries were imposed by the wallpaper group? (In your own words.)
    * How did you work with these symmetries to produce an interesting pattern?
    * How did the wallpaper fit into your overall theme?
* Possible tools:

## Presentation

    * 17 slides, one for each wallpaper group. A short artist statement for each (on the side).
    * Conclusion slide. What thoughts do you want to leave off on with your audience?
    
## Rubric

  * 5 points: Accuracy: Are the symmetries of each wallpaper group accurately reflected in the pattern? (Use a combination of visual inspection and description.)
  * 5 points: Complexity: Does the pattern demonstrate an understanding of the wallpaper group's symmetries beyond simply applying them? Does it incorporate interesting variations or combinations of the symmetry operations?
  * 5 points: Visual Appeal: Is the pattern aesthetically pleasing? Does it have a sense of balance and harmony?
