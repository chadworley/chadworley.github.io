# ALEKS Test Day

End-of-Year **Knowledge Check**!

* Go to your 6th grade ALEKS class (even if you have been doing work in a different one!)
* Use paper, and try your best on all problems. 
* A calculator should be used **only** when ALEKS gives you one.
* **SILENCE ALL PERIOD**
* Dr. Huston will be stopping by to make sure we are all taking this test under standard testing conditions.
* Please take your time to try your best. If you rush, we will have to reset the test. It is important for us to get an accurate measure of your understanding.
* Make smart guesses! Use process of elimination.
