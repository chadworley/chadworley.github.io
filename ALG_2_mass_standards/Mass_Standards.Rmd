# N: Number and Quantity

## CN: The Complex Number System
### A. Perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers.

1. Know there is a complex number i such that $i^2 = -1$, and every complex number has the form $a + bi$ with $a$ and $b$ real.
2. Use the relation $i^2 = -1$ and the Commutative, Associative, and Distributive properties to add, subtract, and multiply complex numbers.

### C. Use complex numbers in polynomial identities and equations.

7. Solve quadratic equations with real coefficients that have complex solutions.
8. (+) Extend polynomial identities to the complex numbers. For example, rewrite $x^2 + 4$ as $(x + 2i) (x â€“ 2i)$.
9. (+) Know the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra; show that it is true for quadratic polynomials.

## VM: Vector and Matrix Quantities
### A. Represent and model with vector quantities.

1. (+) Recognize vector quantities as having both magnitude and direction. Represent vector quantities by directed line segments, and use appropriate symbols for vectors and their magnitudes (e.g., $\boldsymbol{v}$, $|v|$, $|| v ||$, $v$).
2. (+) Find the components of a vector by subtracting the coordinates of an initial point from the
coordinates of a terminal point.
3. (+) Solve problems involving velocity and other quantities that can be represented by vectors.
