### A. Extend the properties of exponents to rational exponents.

1. Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents follows from extending the properties of integer exponents to those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms of rational exponents. **For example, we define $5^{1/3}$ to be the cube root of 5 because we want $(5^{1/3})^3 = 5$**.
2. Rewrite expressions involving radicals and rational exponents using the properties of exponents.
