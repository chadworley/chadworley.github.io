### A. Reason quantitatively and use units to solve problems.

1. Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems; choose
and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays.
2. Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.
3. Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities.
   a. Describe the effects of approximate error in measurement and rounding on measurements and
on computed values from measurements. Identify significant figures in recorded measures and
computed values based on the context given and the precision of the tools used to measure.
