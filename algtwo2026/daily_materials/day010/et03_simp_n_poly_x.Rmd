Question
========

Simplify the expression:
$$`r ex2`$$

Answerlist
--------

`r al`


Solution
========

The correct answer is $`r nf`$. The negative gets distributed to each term of the polynomial. (Where each term is a product of a coefficient [a number] times $x$ raised to a whole number.)

I am pretty careful to use the word "term" to mean things added or subtracted. I use "factor" when things are multiplied (or divided I guess). So, each term of the polynomial has two factors: a coefficient and $x$ raised to a whole number.

In short, just change the signs of all the coefficients.
