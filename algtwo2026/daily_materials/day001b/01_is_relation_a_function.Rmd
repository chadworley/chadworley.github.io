Question
========

A [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics)) is expressed as a list of $(x,y)$ ordered pairs.

`r mystr`

In order for $y$ to be a function of $x$, each value of $x$ must always have a consistent value of $y$.

* Is this list consistent with $y$ being a function of $x$? ##ANSWER1##

In order for $x$ to be a function of $y$, each value of $y$ must always have a consistent value of $x$.

* Is this list consistent with $x$ being a function of $y$? ##ANSWER2##

In a [one-to-one function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function), both $x$ and $y$ are functions of each other.

* Is this list consistent with a one-to-one function? ##ANSWER3##
