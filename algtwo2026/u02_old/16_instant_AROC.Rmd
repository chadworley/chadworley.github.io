Question
========

In real life, the [average rate of change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_(mathematics)#Of_change) over a small time interval is used to approximate the instantaneous rate of change (like with a [bicycle's speedometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclocomputer#The_wheel_sensor)). The step size, $h$, is the width of the interval, so we find the average rate of change of $f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=a+h$:

$$\text{AROC} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$

```{python, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
from sympy import *
x = symbols("x")
exp = int(r.a)*x**2+int(r.b)*x+int(r.c)
lexp = latex(exp)
```

Let function $f$ be defined as follows:
$$f(x) = `r py$lexp`$$
**Evaluate** the average rate of change of $f$ at $x=`r p`$ with a step size $h=`r h`$. 

*You can round (or truncate) your final answer at the hundredths place.*


Solution
========

$$f(`r p`)=`r fp`$$
$$f(`r p`+`r h`)=`r fph`$$

$$\text{AROC} = \frac{(`r fph`)-(`r fp`)}{`r h`} = `r round(m,2)` $$
