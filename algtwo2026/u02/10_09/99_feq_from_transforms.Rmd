Question
========

Let $f$ be a function so that the parent curve is $b=f[a]$. A daughter curve can be developed by applying the following transformations:

* Horizontal transformations:
    * First `r ca1` `r ca2`
    * Then `r ca3` `r ca4`
* Vertical transformations:
    * First `r ca5` `r ca6`
    * Then `r ca7` `r ca8`

Which equation describes the daughter curve?


Solution
========


$$y=`r eq`$$
