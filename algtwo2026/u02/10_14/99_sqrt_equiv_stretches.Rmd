```{r,echo=F}
## a sqrt(x) = sqrt(bx)

b = round(runif(1,1.1,3),2)
a = round(sqrt(b),4)

```

Question
========

Different transformations can produce equivalent curves. 

For example, consider the square-root (parent) function stretched horizontally by a factor of `r b` and the square-root function shrunk vertically by a factor of $a$. Using [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator), graph both equations shown below, making a slider for parameter $a$.

$$y=\sqrt{\frac{x}{`r b`}}$$

$$y=\frac{1}{a}\sqrt{x}$$

By adjusting the slider for $a$, determine the vertical-shrink factor that is equivalent to a horizontal-stretch factor of `r b` for a square-root parent function. Please be accurate to the nearest hundredth. (You might need to adjust the limits on slider $a$ for more precision.)

* $a~=~$ ?
