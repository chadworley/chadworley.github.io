# Agenda

* Entrance Ticket
* Parent functions and shifting (translations)

# How to shift...

* Parent function curve is $y=f(x)$.

* To shift **right** by 5 and **down** by 3:
$$y=f(x-5)-3$$
* To shift **right** by 4 and **up** by 8:
$$y=f(x-4)+8$$
* To shift **left** by 2 and **down** by 7:
$$y=f(x+2)-7$$
* To shift **left** by 6 and **up** by 1:
$$y=f(x+6)+1$$
* Notice the horizontal-coordinate transformation is "backwards".
    * This goes back to "set argument to value and solve equation"
    * When solving, you apply INVERSE operations in REVERSE order
    * Those inverses are applied to the old $x$ to get new $x$
* Notice the vertical-coordinate transformation is "normal".
    * We simply replace the $f(\ldots)$ with old $y$ and evaluate expression to get new $y$.
