Question
========

Solve the equation below.
$$`r ques`$$


Solution
========

Rewrite the given equation.
$$`r ques`$$
`r s1`

$$`r y2`=`r e1`$$

`r s2`

$$`r x`=x$$

Switch sides (which is allowed because equality is commutative).

$$x=`r x`$$

You can check your possible answer by substituting `r x` for $x$ in the original equation.

$$`r check1`$$


$$`r y` \stackrel{?}{=} `r fn`$$


$$`r y` \stackrel{\checkmark}{=} `r y`$$

So, indeed we see that $x=`r x`$ is a solution to the equation.
