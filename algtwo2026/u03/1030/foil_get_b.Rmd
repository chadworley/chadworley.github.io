Question
========

Consider the following product of linear binomials:

$$(`r exp1`)(`r exp2`)$$

When the expression is expanded and like terms are combined, an equivalent expression can be expressed in standard form:

$$ax^2+bx+c$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. 

* What is the value of $b$?


Solution
========

* For similar examples that show how to use box method and FOIL:
    * [https://chadworley.github.io/algtwo2026/u03/1029/outhtml/foil_get_b.html](https://chadworley.github.io/algtwo2026/u03/1029/outhtml/foil_get_b.html)
    
You could use the box method or FOIL. Either way, you should first get

$$`r pn(c(A*C,A*D,B*C,B*D),c(2,1,1,0))`$$

And, after combining like terms, you should get
$$`r pn(c(A*C,A*D+B*C,B*D),c(2,1,0))`$$

Thus, $a=`r A*C`$ and $b=`r A*D+B*C`$ and $c=`r B*D`$. This question specifically asked for the value of $b$, so the answer is $`r A*D+B*C`$.
